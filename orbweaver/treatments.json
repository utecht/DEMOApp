At the forefront of medical technology, UAMS offers 3-D mammography as one of the tools to help women in the fight against breast cancer.\nWhat Makes a 3-D Mammogram Different\nThe 3-D mammogram provides a view of the structures within the breast \u2013 such as milk ducts, fat, ligaments and blood vessels \u2013 from angles not available on a traditional 2-D image. Doctors are able to look at sections of the breast as thin as one millimeter to detect breast cancers while they are smaller and more likely to be curable.\nUnlike traditional mammography, the machine is not stationary but moves around the breast to take many x-rays at different angles in a matter of seconds. The 3-D mammography has proven to reduce the number of callbacks for additional tests and therefore decrease patient anxiety. The technology may also be used by any woman upon request.", "providers": [], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": [{"name": "Breast Center", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UAMS-Outpatient-Center-12182019-DSC_8127-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/breast-center/"}]}, "https://uamshealth.com/treatment/ac-joint-reconstruction/": {"name": "Treatment & Procedure: AC Joint Reconstruction", "aka": "Also called: Acromioclavicular Joint Reconstruction", "description": "Also called: Acromioclavicular Joint Reconstruction", "providers": [{"name": "Tyler L.

Everyone has a slightly different tumor and responds to therapy in a different way, which makes treatment challenging. However, technology is changing that right now.\nIn some cases, genetic testing reveals a tumor type with a known treatment. Sometimes patients are a match for an ongoing clinical trial. For others, the researchers use these samples to grow more cells in the lab and test different compounds on the unique tumor types in the search for new therapies. Pharmacologists at UAMS assist the researchers in developing the specific compounds.\nThese results are being compiled and analyzed with the help of the UAMS Department of Biomedical Informatics. As trends emerge from the massive amounts of data, more patients will gain access to personalized treatment solutions based upon the specific characteristics and genetics of their tumor. The data analysis is also helping the researchers understand how these tumors form in the first place, providing an additional means of prevention in the future.\nScientists have long had ideas of how personalized medicine might look in the neurosurgical oncology setting. The patient takes a genetic test, perhaps from a sample of their tumor or maybe even a blood test, and those genetic results determine the best treatment.

These surgical techniques are only practiced at a handful of institutions in the nation.\nA recent evolution in neurosurgical technologies has led to a way to treat the most serious kinds of brain tumors and stroke while preserving brain function, which was previously thought impossible. UAMS is home to the first neurosurgeon in the state of Arkansas to use the BrainPath\u00ae technology.\nThis cutting edge technology uses a BrainPath\u00ae tube, advanced imaging of tracts in the brain and a computerized brain navigation system, which allows physicians to navigate the brain with unprecedented clarity to target and suction out deep-seated brain tumors, abscesses and hemorrhages with much less disruption of tissue than with traditional techniques.\nWhile individual technologies have been available for more than a decade, they have primarily been used independent of one another. Neurosurgery has now evolved to reach the\u00a0Final Frontier by using the new 6 Pillar Approach. The BrainPath\u00ae is part of the 6 Pillar Approach that uses several advanced technologies. The Pillars of the approach include: brain imaging, neuro-navigation, access, high-definition optics, resection (removal) of the abnormality, and tissue collection for regenerative medicine options.\n\nThe procedure is the closest that surgeons can get to a precisely targeted, flawless surgery for deep brain tumors.\u00a0 Surgeons are able to get to tumors in a much safer way that will put patients at less risk of brain damage and will preserve critical brain structures and tracts.\nThe many benefits of the breakthrough procedure, which creates a small, dime-sized channel through the brain, include faster recovery time, minimal internal and external scarring, less trauma to the brain and nerves, and few side effects and complications post-surgery. The procedure trumps traditional open surgery because a limited opening is created to access deep in the brain, so less of the brain is exposed, and the brain tissue is minimally disrupted.", "providers": [{"name": "J.

UAMS is renowned for this service. When the cornea is removed and replaced with healthy donor tissue, it comes from the on-site Lions Eye Bank and Laboratory, which serves the entire state and is one of the most heavily supported in the nation.\nAbout Corneal Transplantation Surgery\nCorneal transplantation is a surgery to replace a cornea that is damaged. The\u00a0cornea is the eye\u2019s outermost layer. It is a clear, strong layer on the\u00a0front of your eye and helps protect your eye from germs and infections. Your corneas also\u00a0help control how light enters your eye; keeping it clear and healthy is necessary for good vision.\nWhy a corneal transplantation is\u00a0needed\nCertain health problems can damage the cornea, causing cloudiness, opacity and a distorted shape. These problems can harm your eyesight and in severe cases can even cause blindness. A corneal transplantation removes the damaged cornea and replaces it with one that is healthy and clear. Most people have good eyesight for many years after corneal transplantation.\nSome conditions that can damage a cornea and require corneal transplantation are:\n\nBulging of the cornea (keratoconus)\nEndothelial dysfunction (Fuch dystrophy)\nSwelling of the cornea (bullous keratopathy)\nScarring of the cornea (from previous infection or injury)\nBuildup of substances on the cornea (corneal dystrophy)\nInflammation of the cornea (keratitis)\nComplications after\u00a0cataract surgery\n\nTypes of corneal transplantation\nThere are 3 main types of corneal transplantation:\n\nPenetrating keratoplasty.\u00a0This is the most common type. A surgeon removes the central part of your damaged cornea and sews on a full thickness corneal graft.\nDescemet membrane (or endothelial) keratoplasty. This type of surgery is less common. Only the innermost damaged layer of the cornea is replaced.\nAnterior lamellar keratoplasty.\u00a0This surgery replaces the anterior layer of the cornea.\n\nThis surgery ranges from partial thickness to full thickness and depends on how much of your cornea has been damaged. Our specialists provide personalized treatment and\u00a0will tell you which type is best for you.\nHow corneal transplantation is done\nAt UAMS, your surgery will be done by a fellowship-trained cornea specialist. He or she will use a very fine thread (sutures) to sew the donor cornea in place. Alternatively, depending on what type of corneal transplant you require, an air bubble may be put in your eye to keep the new graft in place. This is used for endothelial transplants.\nRisks of corneal transplantation\nAll procedures have risks. Risks of corneal transplantation are:\n\nNew refractive errors (changes in vision) that need correcting with\u00a0eyeglasses\u00a0or contact lenses\nInfection of the cornea\nWorsening of glaucoma\nBleeding in the eye\nSore on the eye (ulcer or abscess)\nBlood vessels growing in the cornea caused by the sutures\nDetachment of the new cornea\nClouding of the eye\u2019s lens (cataract)\nDetachment of the\u00a0retina\nEye inflammation\nFailure of the surgery to fix your eyesight\n\nAnother serious risk is rejection of the donor cornea where your immune system may attack the new cornea. This can cause the transplant to fail. If this happens, you will likely need another corneal transplantation and a corneal surgeon trained in high-risk grafts may be involved in your care. To lower your risk for rejection, talk with your eye doctor about the risks and symptoms of rejection. Contact us\u00a0if you have any of these symptoms. Early treatment may prevent loss of your eyesight.\nYour risks may differ based on your age, your overall health and the cause of your damaged cornea. Our team will talk to you\u00a0about which risks apply most to you and if you are a good candidate for this surgery.", "providers": [{"name": "William Clarence Beck, M.D.", "picture": "/wp-content/plugins/UAMSWP-Find-a-Doc/assets/svg/no-image_3-4.jpg", "specialty": "Trauma Surgeon", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/william-clarence-beck/"}, {"name": "P.

Our surgeons use the da Vinci Surgical System for a growing number of procedures and treatment areas.\nWhy Robotic Surgery?\nThe da Vinci Surgical System provides our surgeons with an alternative to both traditional open surgery and conventional laparoscopy, putting a surgeon\u2019s hands at the controls of a state-of-the-art robotic platform. The da Vinci System enables our surgeons to perform even the most complex and delicate procedures through very small (1- to 2-centimeter) incisions with unmatched precision.\nBy integrating robotic technology with the surgeon\u2019s skill, the da Vinci System enables UAMS surgeons to perform precise minimally invasive surgeries with unparalleled accuracy.\nMore Precise, Less Invasive Surgery\nMinimally invasive surgical procedures allow UAMS surgeons to operate through very small ports (dime-sized) rather than large incisions, resulting in shorter recovery times, fewer complications and reduced hospitalization costs.\nThe benefits to the patient may include:\n\nSignificantly less pain\nLess blood loss\nLess scarring\nShorter recovery time\nA faster return to normal daily activities\nIn many cases, better clinical outcomes\n\nDa Vinci Surgery Technology\nWith da Vinci, small incisions are made to introduce miniaturized wristed instruments and a high-definition 3D camera. The surgeon, seated comfortably at a console, views a magnified, high-resolution 3D image of the surgical site.\nSimultaneously, state-of-the-art robotic and computer technologies scale, filter and seamlessly convert the surgeon\u2019s hand movements into precise micro-movements of the da Vinci instruments.\nThe system cannot be programmed, nor can it make decisions on its own. Rather, the da Vinci System requires that every surgical movement be performed with direct input from the surgeon.\n\n\n\n\nRobotic Surgery at UAMS using da Vinci Surgical System\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube", "providers": [{"name": "W.

With this in mind, our doctors use their expertise to ensure that diabetic patients maintain proper foot health in order to carry out their everyday functions. Our doctors also equip patients with foot care knowledge so they can prevent foot problems at home.\n\n\n\nThe main concern associated with\u00a0diabetic foot care is neuropathy, which is nerve damage that results in the loss of sensation in the feet and other limbs. Without sensation in the feet, it is easy to suffer blisters, corns and sores, which can cause infection, and serious infections can lead to the loss of limbs. Diabetes can also cause reduced blood flow to the feet and other limbs, which puts patients at risk for ulcers.\nHelpful Tips\nOur\u00a0podiatrists\u00a0recommend that you receive regular foot screenings from your physician to prevent serious foot problems and to visit your physician as soon as possible upon developing a sore, corn, blister, bruise or other injury.\nTo prevent diabetic foot problems from developing, follow these suggestions:\n\nCheck your feet and toes daily for cuts, sores, bruises, bumps or infections.\nWash your feet daily using warm water and mild soap. Avoid soaking the feet for a long period of time. Dry your feet thoroughly.\nCover your feet with petroleum jelly before putting on shoes and socks to prevent dry skin.\nCut toenails straight across.\nWear thick, soft socks and avoid slippery stockings. Never go barefoot.\nExamine your shoes for tears, sharp edges, or objects in them before wearing.\nWear shoes that fit well and allow your toes to move.\nUse an emery board or pumice stone to file away dead skin.

When medication or other typical treatments aren\u2019t working, electroconvulsive therapy may be recommended.\nECT is very effective and works faster than antidepressant medication in improving the symptoms of major depression and suicidal ideation. At the Psychiatric Research Institute (PRI), ECT is one of several therapies we use to treat mental disorders that have not responded to traditional forms of therapy.\nECT is done primarily on an outpatient basis. The recovery period from anesthesia is usually about an hour and patients are able to return home with the assistance of a care-giver. It has proven to be successful for patients who are at risk to themselves, are acutely suicidal and need to be stabilized quickly. It can also be safely used for pregnant women who are having significant problems with depression.\nMost patients receive six to 12 treatments during their initial series, and the treatments are tapered down in frequency while the patient is monitored for stabilization . Depending on their progress, some come back for follow-up treatments while other patients may remain symptom free. The Psychiatric Research Institute at UAMS is one of only two centers in Arkansas to offer ECT to patients. The effectiveness of the therapy and its safety has led to its increased use and success around the world.", "providers": [{"name": "Lou Ann Eads, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/11677/Eads_Lou-Ann-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Geriatric Psychiatrist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/lou-ann-eads/"}, {"name": "Shona L.

We strive to help all patients live seizure-free, even those with refractory epilepsy or those who continue to have seizures after trying multiple treatments.\nPresurgical Evaluation\nIf you do not respond to seizure medications you may benefit from epilepsy surgery, which provides freedom from seizures for up to 80% of patients. Our neurologists and epilepsy specialists can perform a comprehensive presurgical evaluation. Presurgical evaluations usually include:\n\nDetailed history and physical examination\nEEG-video monitoring\nSpecial MRI scans\nPET scan\nNeuropsychological testing\nWada test\nIctal SPECT scan\nFunctional MRI (fMRI) scans\n\nIn some instances, electrode grids are implanted over the brain. Electrical stimulation of these electrodes helps localize functions in the brain that need to be preserved during surgery.\nVagus Nerve Stimulation\nVagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a surgical treatment where a small device is surgically implanted under the skin, over the chest or in the armpit. This flat, round device is about the size of a pocket watch. The device generates electrical impulses that are delivered to the vagus nerve in the neck, which then indirectly affects the brain.\nUAMS offers this procedure for adults and children over the age of 12 who have partial seizures that are resistant to medications.

But this procedure is not always done for cosmetic reasons. Many times the procedure is medically necessary to improve vision.\nThere can be several medical reasons to have the procedure:\n\nNot seeing clearly\nDeclining peripheral vision\nNeeding eyelids to be re-positioned\nHaving tired eyes\n\nPreparing for surgery\nBefore you have the surgery, your doctors at Harvey & Bernice\u00a0Jones Eye Institute\u00a0will work with your primary care doctor or ophthalmologist to coordinate your health care. You will need to stop any medications you are taking that make you bleed. Also, you will have visual field testing twice to determine whether or not your peripheral\u00a0vision will be improved with the surgery. They will also perform a dry eye evaluation and take photos of what you look like before the surgery.\nFor your insurance, our doctors will send the photos and the field visual field test results to demonstrate that the purpose for the surgery is to better your eyesight. Most insurances and Medicare will cover your surgery if there is medical proof that you are having this procedure for visual improvement.\nThe procedure\nThis is an outpatient procedure, so you will be able to go home the same day. During the surgery, you will be given anesthesia but will not be asleep. Our doctors will make the incision in the crease of your eyelid so it will not be visible after surgery. Your surgeon will then remove the excess fat and loose skin from the eyelid. The surgery will last between 45 minutes and an hour for both eyelids.\nAfter surgery\nAfter the surgery, you will need to keep a cool pack on your eyelids for 10 minutes out of each hour that you are awake for the first 24 hours after surgery. We also recommend that you keep your head elevated. You will experience some bruising for seven to 10 days after the surgery. The stitches will be removed four to six days after the procedure. You will be given an antibiotic ointment to put on your eyes for a week.", "providers": [], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": []}, "https://uamshealth.com/treatment/fall-prevention/": {"name": "Treatment & Procedure: Fall Prevention", "description": "Between 35 and 40% of adults 65 years old or older fall annually, and falls are the leading cause of accidental injury in the home.

These include:\n\ncervical and uterine cancer\nuterine fibroids\nendometriosis\nuterine prolapse\nmenorrhagia (excessive bleeding)\n\nTraditional vs. Robotic Surgery\nTraditional\u00a0open gynecologic surgery, using a large incision for access to the uterus and surrounding anatomy, has for many years been the standard approach to many gynecologic procedures. This form of surgery can result in significant pain, trauma, a long recovery process and threat to surrounding organs and nerves. For women facing gynecologic surgery, the period of pain, discomfort and extended time away from normal daily activities that usually follows traditional surgery can understandably cause significant anxiety.\nFortunately,\u00a0less invasive options\u00a0are available. Some gynecologic procedures enable surgeons to access the target anatomy using a vaginal approach, which may not require an external incision. But for complex hysterectomies and other gynecologic procedures, robot-assisted surgery with the\u00a0da Vinci\u00a0Surgical System\u00a0may be the most effective, least invasive treatment option. Through tiny (1- to 2-centimeter incisions) UAMS surgeons using the\u00a0da Vinci\u00a0System can operate with greater precision and control, minimizing the pain and risk associated with large incisions while increasing the likelihood of a fast recovery and excellent outcomes.", "providers": [], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": []}, "https://uamshealth.com/treatment/gynecology-annual-exams/": {"name": "Treatment & Procedure: Gynecology Annual Exams", "description": "", "providers": [{"name": "Nancy Andrews Collins, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/54674/Collins_Nancy-Andrews-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Obstetrician/Gynecologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/nancy-andrews-collins/"}, {"name": "William W.  \"Sam\" Greenfield, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/11712/Greenfield_William-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Obstetrician/Gynecologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/william-w-greenfield/"}, {"name": "Laura L.

Each year in the U.S. alone, doctors perform approximately 600,000 hysterectomies, making it the second most common surgical procedure.\nTypes of Hysterectomy\nThere are various types of hysterectomy that are performed depending on the patient\u2019s diagnosis:\nSupracervical hysterectomy\u00a0\u2013 removes the uterus, leaves cervix intact\nTotal hysterectomy\u00a0\u2013 removes the uterus and cervix\nRadical hysterectomy\u00a0or\u00a0modified radical hysterectomy\u00a0\u2013 a more extensive surgery for gynecologic cancer that includes removing the uterus and cervix and may also remove part of the vagina, fallopian tubes, ovaries and lymph nodes in order to stage the cancer (determine how far it has spread)\nApproaches to Hysterectomy\nSurgeons perform the majority of hysterectomies using an \u201copen\u201d approach, which is through a large abdominal incision. An open approach to the hysterectomy procedure requires a 6 \u2013 12-inch incision. When cancer is involved, the conventional treatment has always been open surgery using a large abdominal incision in order to see and, if necessary, remove related structures like the cervix or the ovaries.\nA second approach to hysterectomy, vaginal hysterectomy, involves removal of the uterus through the vagina, without any external incision or subsequent scarring. Surgeons most often use this minimally invasive approach if the patient\u2019s condition is benign (noncancerous), when the uterus is normal size and the condition is limited to the uterus.\nIn laparoscopic hysterectomy, the uterus is removed either vaginally or through small incisions made in the abdomen. The surgeon can see the target anatomy on a standard 2D video monitor using a miniaturized camera inserted into the abdomen through the small incisions. A laparoscopic approach offers surgeons better visualization of affected structures than either vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy alone.\nWhile minimally invasive vaginal and laparoscopic hysterectomies offer obvious potential advantages to patients over open abdominal hysterectomy \u2013 including reduced risk for complications, a shorter hospitalization and faster recovery \u2013 there are inherent drawbacks. With vaginal hysterectomy, surgeons are challenged by a small working space and lack of view to the pelvic organs. Additional conditions can make the vaginal approach difficult, including when the patient has:\n\nA narrow pubic arch (an area between the hip bones where they come together)\nThick adhesions due to prior pelvic surgery, such as C-section\nSevere endometriosis\nNonlocalized cancer (cancer outside the uterus) requiring more extensive tissue removal, including lymph nodes\n\nWith laparoscopic hysterectomy, surgeons may be limited in their dexterity and by 2D visualization, potentially reducing the surgeon\u2019s precision and control when compared with traditional abdominal surgery.\nda Vinci Hysterectomy\nA new, minimally invasive approach to hysterectomy, da Vinci Hysterectomy, combines the advantages of conventional open and minimally invasive hysterectomies but with far fewer drawbacks. Using the da Vinci System, surgeons are able to perform surgical procedures with unmatched precision, dexterity and control.\nPlease contact us for additional information on the minimally invasive da Vinci robotic robotic surgery at UAMS.", "providers": [], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": []}, "https://uamshealth.com/treatment/hysteroscopy/": {"name": "Treatment & Procedure: Hysteroscopy", "description": "", "providers": [{"name": "Nancy Andrews Collins, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/54674/Collins_Nancy-Andrews-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Obstetrician/Gynecologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/nancy-andrews-collins/"}, {"name": "William W.  \"Sam\" Greenfield, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/11712/Greenfield_William-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Obstetrician/Gynecologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/william-w-greenfield/"}, {"name": "Melissa S.

Research shows that a combination of medication and therapy can successfully treat these disorders and, for some people struggling with addiction, MAT can help sustain recovery.\nHow MAT Can Help\nMAT is mainly used to treat addiction to opioids, such as heroin and prescription pain relievers that contain opiates. The medication that is prescribed through MAT operates to normalize brain chemistry, block the effects of alcohol and opioids, relieve cravings, and normalize body functions without the negative effects of the abused drug. People may safely take medications used in MAT for months, years, several years, or even a lifetime.\nThe most common medications to treat opioid dependence include:\n\nMethadone\nBuprenorphine\nNaltrexone\nNaloxone\n\nThe Effectiveness of Medication-Assisted Treatment\nThe goal of MAT is full\u00a0recovery and includes the ability to live a self-directed life. This treatment approach has been shown to:\n\nImprove patient survival\nIncrease retention in treatment\nDecrease illicit opiate use and other criminal activity among people with substance use disorders\nIncrease patients\u2019 ability to gain and maintain employment\nImprove birth outcomes among women who have substance use disorders and are pregnant", "providers": [{"name": "Shona L.

Uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths that can appear in your uterus during your childbearing years. For women who want to become pregnant, your chances of pregnancy may be improved by having uterine fibroids removed.\nTypes of Myomectomy\nThere are three surgical methods for myomectomy: hysteroscopy, laparoscopy and laparotomy. Several factors determine which method will be used:\n\nSize\nLocation\nNumber of fibroids\nNeed to correct urinary or bowel issues\n\nDuring a\u00a0hysteroscopy\u00a0procedure, a lighted viewing instrument is inserted through the vagina and into the uterus. This technique is done to remove fibroids on the inner wall of the uterus that are not deep. This is an outpatient procedure, and recovery time varies from a few days to as long as two weeks.\nLaparoscopy\u00a0is a minimally invasive procedure in which your doctor will make a small incision in or near your belly button to remove the fibroid. This method is typically used when you need to remove one or two fibroids, no larger than two inches across, that are growing on the outside of the uterus. A laparoscopy can be done on an outpatient basis, but you may need to stay in the hospital overnight. Recovery time is usually one to two weeks.\nA\u00a0laparotomy\u00a0requires a full abdominal incision, either vertically or horizontally, under general anesthesia. Using an incision in your uterus down to the level of the fibroid, this technique is used to remove multiple fibroids, large fibroids or fibroids that have grown deep into your uterine wall. You will need to stay in the hospital for one to four days with a complete recovery time of four to six weeks.\nAfter Myomectomy Surgery\nAfter surgery, many women will experience some excessive menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain or pressure. Fibroids could return, but they may or may not require treatment. However, women who plan a pregnancy after a myomectomy often are able to conceive within one year of having the surgery.", "providers": [{"name": "Gloria A.

A piece of cotton, a brush or a small wooden stick is used to gently scrape cells from the cervix and vagina. The cells are viewed under a microscope to find out if they are abnormal. This procedure is also called a Pap smear.\nHow Often Should You Be Screened?\nEvery woman\u2019s situation is unique.\u00a0You should talk with your doctor about when to start screening and how often to be screened.\nHowever, in August 2018, updated screening guidelines were released by the United States Preventive Services Task Force. The updated guidelines are as follows:\n\nWomen ages 21 through 29 should be screened with a Pap test every 3 years\nWomen ages 30 through 65 should be screened with any of three tests:\n\nEvery 5 years with high-risk HPV testing alone\nEvery 5 years with Pap and high-risk HPV cotesting\nEvery 3 years with a Pap test alone\n\n\n\nIt is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily think you have cancer if they suggest a screening test. Screening tests are standard, and are given even when you have no cancer symptoms.\nIf a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called diagnostic tests.\nWhy a Pap smear (or Pap test) is Important\nRegular screening for cervical cancer using the Pap test has decreased the number of new cases of cervical cancer and the number of deaths due to cervical cancer since 1950.\nCervical dysplasia (the abnormal growth of cells on the surface of the cervix) occurs more often in women who are in their 20s and 30s. Death from cervical cancer is rare in women younger than 30 years and in women of any age who have regular screenings with the Pap test.\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the major risk factor for cervical cancer.\nAlthough most women with cervical cancer have the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, not all women with an HPV infection will develop cervical cancer. Many different types of HPV can affect the cervix and only some of them cause abnormal cells that may become cancer. Some HPV infections go away without treatment.\nHPV infections are spread mainly through sexual contact. Women who become sexually active at a young age and have many sexual partners are at increased risk for HPV infections.\nOther risk factors for cervical cancer include:\n\nGiving birth to many children.\nSmoking cigarettes.\nHaving a weakened immune system.\n\nAgain, you should talk with your doctor about when to start screening and how often to be screened.", "providers": [{"name": "Nancy Andrews Collins, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/54674/Collins_Nancy-Andrews-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Obstetrician/Gynecologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/nancy-andrews-collins/"}, {"name": "William W.  \"Sam\" Greenfield, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/11712/Greenfield_William-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Obstetrician/Gynecologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/william-w-greenfield/"}, {"name": "Melissa S.

The device is designed to divert blood flow away from the aneurysm. Over time the vessel is reinforced and reformed, and the aneurysm is no longer a threat.\nPipeline is composed of 48 braided strands of cobalt chromium and platinum tungsten. The device is pushed through the microcatheter and then deployed by a combination of microcatheter withdrawal and forward pressure on the delivery wire.\nMany times these types of aneurysms are operated on and clipped, which can have a 50 percent morbidity rate. However, the Pipeline procedure has a 95 percent survival rate. Also, compared to clipping, this procedure is less invasive and requires a shorter hospital stay. The procedure lasts between two and four hours. After the Pipeline procedure, patients can go home the next day.

Therefore, treatment must be carefully planned to minimize side effects.The radiation used for cancer treatment may come from a machine outside the body, or it may come from radioactive material placed in the body near tumor cells or injected into the bloodstream.A patient may receive radiation therapy before, during or after surgery, depending on the type of cancer being treated.For certain types of cancer, radiation therapy alone is the best treatment.

We work with a wide variety of sexual dysfunctions, including loss of desire, arousal disorders, orgasmic difficulties, sexual pain issues, sexless marriages, unusual arousal templates, sexual trauma, compulsive sexual behaviors, and the necessary adjustments that come with chronic illness and the sexual changes we experience as we age.\nEnrichment and Education\nSexual enrichment is an area that people seek assistance with when they are not necessarily having functional problems, but have found that their sex lives have become stagnant, they have \u201clost that loving feeling\u201d and drifted into a low-sex, no-sex relationship.\nSex education is a key component of sex therapy, as most of us receive such poor education about this important area of our lives. The most important aspect of sex therapy is the opportunity to ask questions, to normalize feelings, and to talk freely about concerns, particularly the common questions about what is \u201cnormal.\u201d\nA Personal Approach to Sex Therapy\nWe welcome clients of all ages, sexual orientations and gender identities.\u00a0UAMS provides a safe space in which you can address questions and concerns about pornography use, fetishes, unusual arousal templates, and questions about sexual orientation.\nIn the process of assessing your particular situation, our providers can help discern if the problem might have a medical basis that requires a referral to assess the medical dimensions underlying certain problems.\u00a0 For example, many people are unaware that certain medications have significant sexual side effects that interfere with arousal and orgasm; or that erectile dysfunction is an early sign of cardio-vascular disease.\nWhat You Can Learn\nSexual difficulties are common in long-term relationships and working in the intersection of the relationship and a couple\u2019s sexuality can profoundly improve a couple\u2019s relationship satisfaction. Sexual self-awareness and the ability to communicate are key factors in sexual satisfaction, and our program director Dr. Wakefield\u2019s process helps people to:\n\nGain insight into who they are as sexual beings \u2013 beyond the performance based scripts we are encouraged to adopt in modern society. This might include defining yourself as a sexual being for the first time and differentiated yourself from the scripts you have been handed, or who your partner wants you to be.\nDevelop a sexual voice and the courage to self-reveal, exchange information, and listen compassionately to what your partner has to reveal without feeling pressured, shamed, or manipulated.\nOpening up new possibilities through education and exploration, while working with fears, concerns and historical influences that stand in the way of embracing those new possibilities. Redefining what it means to be \u201csexual.\u201d\nSupporting a couple to become a \u201cteam\u201d who works together to define and create a fulfilling sex life based on their health, values, individual sexualities, and the unique situations that affect two people\u2019s intersecting lives.\n\nAll of this can greatly improve both the sexual and relationship satisfaction.", "providers": [{"name": "Chelsea M.

If you have personal or professional regrets about a tattoo, you don\u2019t have to continue to live with unwanted body art. The\u00a0Dermatology Clinic at UAMS has the technology and expertise to remove tattoos.\nTo completely remove a tattoo, new treatments using lasers, which are more effective and cause less scarring than older surgical excision or dermabrasion procedures, can eliminate your tattoo with minimal side effects. At UAMS, we use state-of-the-art laser equipment to provide safe and effective personalized treatment.\nBefore Tattoo Removal\nYour doctor will meet with you to help determine the type of laser to be used and the number of treatments needed to remove your tattoo. We will provide detailed information about your procedure and will advise you of the results you can expect.\nDuring the Tattoo Removal Procedure\nAt the beginning of the procedure, your doctor will apply numbing cream or inject a local anesthetic to help with any discomfort. After the anesthetic begins to work, your doctor will move a high-intensity laser over the area. Our experts use specific wavelengths of light, based on the color and age of the tattoo.\nThe laser light penetrates only fractions of a millimeter into the skin, breaking down the pigment in the ink in the tattoo. This allows your body to remove the ink as part of your natural processes. The discomfort is minimal (comparable to having a rubber band snapped against your skin). And each treatment session is brief, generally lasting only a few minutes. If needed, ice can be applied immediately after a treatment to help cool the skin and soothe any discomfort.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou will need to use an antibiotic ointment on the treated area to help the area heal.", "providers": [{"name": "Jay M.

UAMS has joined the ranks of prestigious health centers around the country now offering TMS therapy for patients with major depressive disorder.\nSimilar to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, TMS therapy stimulates areas of the brain that are underactive in depression. Performed on an outpatient basis, TMS is performed while the patient sits comfortably in a relaxing chair. Sessions take a little more than 30 minutes and are administered five days a week for up to four to six weeks.\nWith TMS, there are none of the side effects commonly associated with antidepressant medication and patients remain awake and alert throughout the treatment. TMS is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of depression, and has shown to be effective in helping those patients who have failed to benefit from medications. No sedation is necessary during the therapy and there is minimal discomfort throughout the treatment.\nTMS patients must not have:\n\nA neurological condition such as epilepsy, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, increased intracranial pressure or tumors in the central nervous system;\nA history of severe head trauma;\nAny metal implants in or around the head;\nA vagus nerve stimulator or implants controlled by physiologic signals, such as a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.", "providers": [{"name": "Lou Ann Eads, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/11677/Eads_Lou-Ann-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Geriatric Psychiatrist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/lou-ann-eads/"}], "areas_of_expertise": [{"name": "Behavioral Health", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Behavioral-health-area-of-expertise-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/expertise/behavioral-care/"}], "locations": [{"name": "Interventional Psychiatry Program", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Psychiatric-Research-Institute-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/interventional-psychiatry-program/"}]}, "https://uamshealth.com/treatment/transforaminal-injections/": {"name": "Treatment & Procedure: Transforaminal Epidural Steroid Injections", "aka": "Also called: Transforaminal Injections", "description": "Also called: Transforaminal Injections", "providers": [{"name": "Johnathan H.

A certificate of vaccination approved by the World Health Organization is provided for all vaccinations received at the clinic.\nInsurance coverage for travel medicine shots and prescriptions varies, so please check directly with your medical insurance carrier for details on your coverage.\nTravel Medicine FAQs\n\nWhat are the advantages of going to UAMS\u2019 Travel Medicine Clinic for my shots/tests?\nWe are highly experienced in prevention and immunization for foreign travel. For many years we have provided services to new immigrants to the U.S. as well as to UAMS employees who join us from many countries. We maintain current knowledge of infectious diseases to offer up-to-date recommendations to you.\nHow far in advance of my trip do I need to worry about travel medicine?\nThere\u2019s really no such thing as too much advance planning in this matter. Most immunizations can be obtained months in advance, while prescriptions can be held and filled just prior to departure. Getting travel medicine services closer than 15 days prior to departure is pushing the deadline and less than 10 days will not allow enough time for immunizations to be effective. If you are visiting a country where the yellow fever vaccine is required, entry will be denied if you do not receive your vaccine at least 10 days before arrival.\nHow do I find out what I need for travel to a particular country?\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a reliable source of information. You can call the CDC at 1-877-FYI-TRIP (1-877-394-8747) or access the\u00a0CDC Web site. Another excellent resource is the\u00a0World Health Organization\u2019s Web site.\nWhat happens if I need to travel to a country and do not want to take one of the listed shots?\nCountries vary on requirements for short term travelers, and the UAMS Travel Medicine Clinic will work to ensure that you meet all the requirements for the countries you will be visiting. In countries where yellow fever vaccines are required, border control officials will deny entry to visitors who have not been vaccinated. The requirements for persons seeking longer term visas or residency permits are usually more extensive than the requirements for short term travelers, so additional testing and more extensive immunizations may be required.\nWhat about my children? Can UAMS be involved in their travel medicine needs as well?\nYes, we are able to provide travel medicine services to children. You may need to allow an extra day or two so that we can order pediatric doses for some immunizations from our supplier.\nAre my risks of contacting AIDS and other blood-borne pathogens higher in developing countries?\nNot necessarily. There are some developing countries that have a much higher prevalence of AIDS, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C than in the U.S. This may change the odds of becoming infected for a traveler engaged in risky behavior. You can avoid contracting illnesses by taking the same precautions you would take at home (avoidance of unprotected sexual contact, sharing of needles or other contact with body fluids).\nWhat is malaria?\nMalaria is a blood parasite that is spread by mosquitoes in some areas of the world. Malaria infection can be prevented by taking steps to reduce exposure to mosquitoes and by taking anti-malaria medications. These medications are not without side effects, so you and your itinerary need to be analyzed individually at our clinic. For example, travel to major cities that are free of malaria may not call for taking these medications whereas travel to more rural destinations in the same country would require this treatment. These details can be explored further during your personalized consultation at our clinic.\nWhat does someone do if they become seriously ill overseas?\nIf you have a pre-existing condition such as advanced heart disease that may place you at higher risk of health adversity abroad, we advise you to identify in advance suitable hospitals and healthcare facilities in the region of travel. The\u00a0U.S. State Department Web site\u00a0has excellent free information and links regarding medical emergencies abroad.\nIf Medical Care Is Needed Abroad\nIf a U.S. citizen becomes seriously ill or is injured abroad, a U.S. consular officer can assist in locating appropriate medical services and informing family or friends. If necessary, an officer can also assist in the transfer of funds from the U.S. However, payment of hospital and other expenses is the responsibility of the traveler.\nProtection against potentially hazardous drugs is nonexistent in some countries, increasing the risk of adverse reactions. Do not buy medications \u201cover the counter\u201d unless you are familiar with the product.\nBefore going abroad, learn what medical services your health insurance will cover. If your health insurance policy provides coverage outside the U.S., remember to carry both your insurance policy identification card and a claim form. Although some health insurance companies will pay \u201ccustomary and reasonable\u201d hospital costs abroad, very few will pay for medical evacuation to the U.S. Medical evacuation can easily cost $10,000 or more, depending on the location and medical condition. Services such as\u00a0www.insuremytrip.com\u00a0may be helpful in seeking out supplemental insurance for your travels.", "providers": [], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": []}, "https://uamshealth.com/treatment/trigger-finger-release-surgery/": {"name": "Treatment & Procedure: Trigger Finger Release Surgery", "description": "", "providers": [{"name": "Patrick Shea Brannan, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/968568/Brannan_Patrick-Shea-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Orthopaedic Surgeon", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/patrick-s-brannan/"}], "areas_of_expertise": [{"name": "Hand and Upper Extremity Orthopaedics", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/iStock-183826655-1-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/expertise/orthopaedics/hand-and-upper-extremity-orthopaedics/"}], "locations": [{"name": "Orthopaedic Clinic\u00a0\u2014 Autumn Road", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/autumn-road-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/orthopaedic-clinic-autumn-road/"}, {"name": "UAMS Baptist Health Orthopaedic Clinic \u2014 Conway", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Baptist-Conway-Ortho-sized-scaled-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/uams-baptist-health-orthopaedic-clinic-conway/"}]}, "https://uamshealth.com/treatment/trigger-point-injections/": {"name": "Treatment & Procedure: Trigger Point Injections", "description": "", "providers": [{"name": "Antonio T.

You will probably feel sore for a few days after the surgery and should rest for at least one day. Complications, if any, are usually minor and easily treated.\nWhat to Know About Your Vasectomy\nYou should know that the vasectomy procedure does not work immediately. It may take weeks before the surgery will completely take effect, so you might\u00a0need to use another method of birth control until then. Your UAMS doctor will provide all the information you need during your follow-up visits after your vasectomy.\nIn most cases, a vasectomy is considered a permanent procedure.

Patients generally recover quickly and enjoy a higher quality of life. At UAMS, our\u00a0interventional radiology\u00a0experts offer hope to liver cancer patients who have exhausted other treatment options.\nHow Y-90 Treats Liver Tumors\nLiver tumors are often inoperable because they are too large, too numerous or have grown into blood vessels or other vital structures. For some patients, chemotherapy becomes ineffective or causes poor quality of life during and after treatment.\nUsing Y-90, millions of tiny radioactive beads are injected directly into arteries, delivering radiation directly to tumors without harming healthy cells. The beads emit radiation for about 10 days, but they will keep working for several months after they are injected.\nAfter being injected, the beads become lodged within the tumor vessels, causing the cells to die. This procedure reverses the progression of liver tumor growth, shrinking the tumors without any adverse effects. With this treatment, our doctors can attack the cancer tumor from inside the body without medicating or affecting other parts of the body.", "providers": [], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": [{"name": "Interventional Radiology Clinic \u2014 Outpatient Center", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UAMS-Outpatient-Center-12182019-DSC_8127-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/interventional-radiology-clinic/"}]}}
