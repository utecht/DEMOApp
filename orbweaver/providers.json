He worked as a clinical stroke fellow at Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., with National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke team, where he learned the nuances of acute stroke management. He did a medicine internship and followed by a neurology residency at University of Louisville School of Medicine, where he also served as a chief resident in his final year.\nThe residency peaked his interest in movement disorders, which led to a two-year fellowship in movement disorders at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston under the direction of Dr. Joseph Jankovic. As he gained expertise in managing patients with a variety of complex movement disorders, deep brain stimulation (DBS), botulinum toxin injections, he also developed an affinity for clinical research. In his second year, he served as chief fellow, a DBS fellow, and was an educator for the neurology residents and medical students.\nAfter completing his training, Dr. Lotia joined the UAMS Movement Disorder team. While he has active interest in treating different conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, tremors, dystonia, etc., he is also passionate about treating patients with Tourette syndrome. He is the only movement disorder neurologist in the state of Arkansas with active clinical and research interest in the treatment of this unique neuropsychiatric condition, which is often underdiagnosed and undertreated.

She completed her medical degree at UAMS in 2002, graduating with honors in research. She then completed her residency training in Obstetrics and Gynecology at UAMS, finishing in 2006. During residency, Dr. McGraw was awarded the Willis Brown Resident Research Award (2006), as well as Excellence in Teaching Awards each year. Dr. McGraw spent 11 years in private practice and was thrilled to have the opportunity to return to the institution where she trained! She continues to provide clinical obstetric and gynecologic care for her patients as she did in private practice, but now also has the privilege to help supervise and teach medical students and physicians in training.\nSince her arrival at UAMS, Dr. McGraw has been honored to serve on a number of committees including the Baby Friendly Task Force, which aided in achieving a \u201cBaby-Friendly Designation\u201d for UAMS from Baby-Friendly USA, a credentialing program for hospitals which is part of an international initiative by the World Health Organization and UN Children\u2019s Fund, thus highlighting both her and UAMS\u2019 commitment to ensuring that all mothers and newborns receive the best support for breastfeeding success.\nDr. McGraw also serves on the Centering Pregnancy Steering Committee, which has helped oversee the development and initiation of a comprehensive group prenatal care program called Centering Pregnancy. Though Centering Pregnancy has been the standard for prenatal care for almost 20 years across the United States, it is a novel approach to prenatal care in the state of Arkansas. The Centering Pregnancy program holds promise for both improved maternal and neonatal outcomes for Arkansas\u2019 families.\nDr. McGraw is a native of Russellville, Arkansas. She is a member of the Arkansas Medical Society and the Central Arkansas Medical Society. She is a Fellow of the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), and served as an Arkansas Delegate to the ACOG Congressional Leadership Conference in Washington DC (2019), advocating for women\u2019s health for the state of Arkansas.

She received her residency training in the Department of Laboratory Medicine at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF).\u00a0 She began her studies of cell-mediated immunity against human papillomavirus (HPV) in Anna-Barbara Moscicki\u2019s laboratory at UCSF where she also became an Adjunct Assistant Professor and Assistant Director of the Blood Bank. After joining the faculty at UAMS in 2004, Dr. Nakagawa continued her research pursuits in the area of HPV immunology and continued to provide patient care as an Attending Physician for the Transfusion Medicine service in the Department of Pathology.\u00a0 In her research laboratory, her team discovered that patients naturally infected with HPV do better when they can mount T-lymphocyte responses against E6 protein, one of the cancer causing proteins made by HPV. This discovery lead to the design of a therapeutic vaccine for treating patients with cervical dysplasia or pre-cancer. A Phase I clinical trial which tested safety was performed between 2013 and 2015 supported by a grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and a Phase II clinical trial testing its efficacy is currently underway. The pioneering work by Dr. Nakagawa\u2019s research group has been presented at many national and international scientific meetings including at International Papillomavirus Conferences that took place at Barcelona, Spain, Beijing, China, Florinapolis, Brazil, Lisbon, Portugal, and Malm\u00f6, Sweden.

After medical school, he journeyed to Arkansas to complete orthopaedic residency at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) in Little Rock. During the final year of his residency, Dr. Songy was awarded the Chris Hackler Award for Excellence in Medical Ethics; a yearly award recognizing a single resident and faculty in the UAMS College of Medicine who demonstrated exemplary attention to ethical issues that affect patient care.\nFollowing residency, Dr. Songy moved to Rochester, Minn., for a year of training at the Mayo Clinic, where he focused on complex reconstruction of adult and pediatric disorders involving the shoulder and elbow. The Mayo clinic is one of the only places that, in addition to its shoulder training, offers a true, comprehensive elbow educational experience. This includes training in elbow arthroscopy, open reconstruction and elbow replacements. During this time, Dr. Songy also trained with a worldwide leader in tendon transfers for the shoulder, which can be used to treat unfixable rotator cuff tears. The Mayo Clinic provided the unique opportunity to work alongside highly respected surgeons who are recognized internationally for their leadership and authority in the field, including designers of multiple shoulder and elbow replacement systems.\nAfter falling in love with the natural state, Dr. Songy and his family decided to return to Arkansas to join Dr. Wesley Cox in practice at the Shoulder Center of Arkansas.\nIn January 2020, the Shoulder Center of Arkansas and its therapy partner, 201\u2013train-recover-move, in Fayetteville and Rogers became part of the statewide UAMS Health system.
