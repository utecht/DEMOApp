They include prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs.\nWhat is drug use?\nDrug use, or misuse, includes\n\nUsing illegal substances, such as\n\nAnabolic steroids\nClub drugs\nCocaine\nHeroin\nInhalants\nMarijuana\nMethamphetamines\n\nMisusing prescription medicines, including opioids. This means taking the medicines in a different way than the health care provider prescribed. This includes\n\nTaking a medicine that was prescribed for someone else\nTaking a larger dose than you are supposed to\nUsing the medicine in a different way than you are supposed to. For example, instead of swallowing your tablets, you might crush and then snort or inject them.\nUsing the medicine for another purpose, such as getting high\n\nMisusing over-the-counter medicines, including using them for another purpose and using them in a different way than you are supposed to\n\nDrug use is dangerous. It can harm your brain and body, sometimes permanently. It can hurt the people around you, including friends, families, kids, and unborn babies. Drug use can also lead to addiction.\nWhat is drug addiction?\nDrug addiction is a chronic brain disease. It causes a person to take drugs repeatedly, despite the harm they cause. Repeated drug use can change the brain and lead to addiction.\nThe brain changes from addiction can be lasting, so drug addiction is considered a \"relapsing\" disease. This means that people in recovery are at risk for taking drugs again, even after years of not taking them.\nDoes everyone who takes drugs become addicted?\nNot everyone who uses drugs becomes addicted. Everyone's bodies and brains are different, so their reactions to drugs can also be different. Some people may become addicted quickly, or it may happen over time. Other people never become addicted. Whether or not someone becomes addicted depends on many factors. They include genetic, environmental, and developmental factors.\nWho is at risk for drug addiction?\nVarious risk factors can make you more likely to become addicted to drugs, including\n\nYour biology. People can react to drugs differently. Some people like the feeling the first time they try a drug and want more. Others hate how it feels and never try it again.\nMental health problems. People who have untreated mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely to become addicted. This can happen because drug use and mental health problems affect the same parts of the brain. Also, people with these problems may use drugs to try to feel better.\nTrouble at home. If your home is an unhappy place or was when you were growing up, you might be more likely to have a drug problem.\nTrouble in school, at work, or with making friends. You might use drugs to get your mind off these problems.\nHanging around other people who use drugs. They might encourage you to try drugs.\nStarting drug use when you're young. When kids use drugs, it affects how their bodies and brains finish growing. This increases your chances of becoming addicted when you're an adult.\n\nWhat are the signs that someone has a drug problem?\nSigns that someone has a drug problem include\n\nChanging friends a lot\nSpending a lot of time alone\nLosing interest in favorite things\nNot taking care of themselves - for example, not taking showers, changing clothes, or brushing their teeth\nBeing really tired and sad\nEating more or eating less than usual\nBeing very energetic, talking fast, or saying things that don't make sense\nBeing in a bad mood\nQuickly changing between feeling bad and feeling good\nSleeping at strange hours\nMissing important appointments\nHaving problems at work or at school\nHaving problems in personal or family relationships\n\nWhat are the treatments for drug addiction?\nTreatments for drug addiction include counseling, medicines, or both. Research shows that combining medicines with counseling gives most people the best chance of success.\nThe counseling may be individual, family, and/or group therapy. It can help you\n\nUnderstand why you got addicted\nSee how drugs changed your behavior\nLearn how to deal with your problems so you won't go back to using drugs\nLearn to avoid places, people, and situations where you might be tempted to use drugs\n\nMedicines can help with the symptoms of withdrawal. For addiction to certain drugs, there are also medicines that can help you re-establish normal brain function and decrease your cravings.\nIf you have a mental disorder along with an addiction, it is known as a dual diagnosis. It is important to treat both problems. This will increase your chance of success.\nIf you have a severe addiction, you may need hospital-based or residential treatment. Residential treatment programs combine housing and treatment services.\nCan drug use and addiction be prevented?\nDrug use and addiction are preventable. Prevention programs involving families, schools, communities, and the media may prevent or reduce drug use and addiction. These programs include education and outreach to help people understand the risks of drug use.\n  NIH: National Institute on Drug AbuseCourtesy of MedlinePlus from the National Library of Medicine.Syndicated Content Details:Source URL: https://medlineplus.gov/druguseandaddiction.html?utm_source=mplusconnect&utm_medium=serviceSource Agency: National Library of Medicine", "providers": [{"name": "Nihit Kumar, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12387/Kumar_Nihit-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Pediatric Psychiatrist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/nihit-kumar/"}], "areas_of_expertise": [{"name": "Behavioral Health", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Behavioral-health-area-of-expertise-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/expertise/behavioral-care/"}], "locations": []}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/adrenal-cancer/": {"name": "Condition: Adrenal Cancer", "aka": "Also called: Adrenocortical Carcinoma", "description": "Also called: Adrenocortical Carcinoma Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the outer layer of the adrenal gland.\nThere are two\u00a0adrenal glands.

Amyloid protein fibers can collect in any tissue or organ, including the kidneys, heart, liver or spleen.\nAmyloid deposits can be generalized and be at several places in the body, or localized, meaning that they gather in only one specific area of the body.\n\nTypes of Amyloidosis\nThere are several different types of amyloid, however, the three\u00a0most common\u00a0types are Amyloid Light Chain (AL), Amyloid Serum A Protein (AA, also known as SAA), and Amyloid Transthyretin (ATTR) which is a hereditary condition.\nIn the United States, AL amyloidosis is the most common type, with about 4,500 new cases diagnosed each year.\nAL amyloidosis is caused by a bone marrow disorder where the bone marrow, in the center of bones, produces abnormal plasma cells.\u00a0\u00a0These abnormal plasma cells normally produce antibodies, also called immunoglobulins. These antibodies are an essential part of the immune system that protects the body from infection. They are composed of four protein chains: two light chains, either kappa or lambda, and two heavy chains.\nIn AL amyloidosis, the plasma cells grow out of control as a single cell type and make abnormal antibodies. The abnormal antibodies enter the blood stream and are deposited as amyloid protein in tissue or organs.\nAL usually affects people between the ages of 50 and 80 and is more common in males than in females, 70% versus 30%.\nSymptoms\nAmyloid protein is deposited in different organs and sites and affects the performance of the site where it is deposited. Depending on which organs are affected and the degree to which organ function is affected, symptoms of AL amyloidosis will vary. Initially, the symptoms can be minor and similar to those of many other conditions. They can come on quickly and be severe. Fatigue, weight loss and swelling, however, are the most common symptoms.\nOrgan-Specific Symptoms:\nKidneys\nKidney disease is common in patients with AL amyloidosis. Amyloid deposits in the kidneys can affect how toxins are filtered from the blood.\u00a0\u00a0This abnormality of the kidneys may result in a condition called nephrotic syndrome, characterized by excess protein in the urine and significant swelling in the lower legs. In some cases, the amyloid deposits cause the kidneys to lose the ability to purify the blood, which can lead to kidney, or renal, failure. Patients with renal failure might need dialysis.\nHeart\nAmyloidosis in the heart can cause it to become thick and stiff, making it unable to function efficiently. This results in shortness of breath, even with just minor exertion. It can also affect the electrical system of the heart, resulting in abnormal heart beat \u2013 a speeding up or slowing down of the heartbeat.\nDigestive System\nAmyloidosis in the digestive system can cause nausea, diarrhea or constipation, weight loss, loss of appetite, or a feeling of fullness in the stomach after eating small amounts. Sometimes the tongue can appear swollen.\nNervous System\nAmyloidosis can affect nerves in the hands, feet and lower legs, causing pain, numbness, tingling, and loss of sensitivity to temperature.\u00a0\u00a0This condition is known as peripheral neuropathy.\u00a0Nerves that control blood pressure, heart rate and other body functions can also be affected, causing a variety of symptoms, including dizziness when standing too quickly, nausea and diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0This is known as autonomic neuropathy.\nOther Symptoms\nOther symptoms that may be present for a period of time prior to diagnosis include chronic fatigue, weakness, weight loss, bruising around the eyes and other areas of skin folds, and swelling in joints.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnostic testing for AL amyloidosis involves blood tests, urine tests and biopsies. Blood and/or urine tests can indicate signs of the amyloid protein, but only bone marrow tests or biopsies of affected tissues or organs can positively confirm the diagnosis.\u00a0Some tests are done only once to establish a diagnosis, while others are repeated periodically to monitor disease progression and response to treatment.\nDiagnostic tests are done in order to\n\u2013 Establish a diagnosis and the extent of the amyloid\n\u2013 Develop a treatment plan and monitor progress\n\u2013 Identify complications so they can be managed and prevented\nBlood and Urine Tests\nBlood and urine are analyzed to detect the abnormal protein produced by the bone marrow plasma cells.\nThe serum Free Light Chain Assay is done to detect changes in the level of free light chains in the blood, which is an indicator of changes in disease activity. Free light chain measurements are done regularly to assess how well treatment is working and to confirm that the amyloid is stable during periods off treatment.\nBiopsy of the affected organ and/or bone marrow\nA biopsy involves the removal of a small sample of tissue to look for evidence of amyloid deposit via microscopic examination. A sample can be taken from an organ, such as the heart or kidneys, from the rectum, or from fat pads under the skin in the abdomen.\nThere are two types of bone marrow tests that may be performed: a bone marrow aspirate (removal of liquid bone marrow) and a bone marrow biopsy (removal of a 1 to 2 cm core of bone marrow tissue). These tests help determine the percentage of amyloid-producing plasma cells which helps guide treatment.\nEchocardiogram and Imaging\nAn echocardiogram of the heart can identify amyloid deposits in the heart and the extent of the amyloid\u2019s impact. The serum BNP is a good marker of heart function. Heart MRI is the definitive imaging method to identify amyloid in the heart.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment for AL amyloidosis is to reduce the abnormal light chain to zero or close to zero to prevent progression of the disease.\nTreatments may include:\n\nDose adjusted Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation is the standard approach for treatment and gives the best responses that are stable for the longest periods of time. Steroids, such as dexamethasone, are used to trigger destruction of abnormal plasma cells.\nThalidomide or Revlimid\u00ae (lenalidomide), are immunomodulatory drugs that enhance the activity of cells in the immune system against the abnormal plasma cells.\nVelcade\u00ae (bortezomib), a proteasome inhibitor, is used to kill tumor cells.\nChemotherapy, typically with Melphalan or Cyclophosphamide, is used to control the growth of abnormal plasma cells that produce amyloid.\n\nSupportive Treatment\nSupportive treatment is helpful for various symptoms, including cardiac and kidney problems, and can improve quality of life.\nDoctors can prescribe medications and treatments, including:\n\nSpecial diet, such as a low-salt diet\nAnti-nausea medication\nMedication to relieve fluid retention\nBlood-thinning medication\nBlood pressure medication\nDialysis if kidney function is severely compromised\n\nIt is important for a patient to consult with a specialist who is knowledgeable about the treatment of amyloid patients.\nPrognosis\nComplete remission, defined as the absence of light chains in the blood, occurs in about 60% of patients. Although organ function can improve in 30%\u201340% of patients after treatment, organ recovery is slow and depends on which organs are affected and how long the damage has been occurring. If treatment begins during the early onset of clinical symptoms, the overall success rate is higher.\nSevere amyloidosis can lead to life-threatening organ failure.\nA multi-disciplinary approach is essential. At the Myeloma Center, the physician team includes myeloma specialists who also treat AL amyloidosis, nephrologists, cardiologists and other specialists as needed.\nEvery patient\u2019s disease is different. The Myeloma Center physicians are dedicated to defining the nuances of each individual\u2019s disease and customizing treatment regimens that have the most promise for effective results.", "providers": [{"name": "Carolina Schinke, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12155/Schinke_Carolina-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/carolina-d-schinke/"}, {"name": "Sharmilan Thanendrarajan, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12242/Thanendrarajan_Sharmilan-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/sharmilan-thanendrarajan/"}, {"name": "Frits van Rhee, M.D., Ph.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/11206/van-Rhee_Frits-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/frits-van-rhee/"}, {"name": "Maurizio Zangari, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12152/Zangari_Maurizio-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/maurizio-zangari/"}], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": [{"name": "Myeloma Center", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cancer-institute-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/myeloma-center/"}]}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/": {"name": "Condition: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)", "aka": "Also called: Lou Gehrig's Disease", "description": "Also called: Lou Gehrig's Disease", "providers": [{"name": "Sukanthi Kovvuru, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/54869/Kovvuru_Sukanthi-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Neurologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/sukanthi-kovvuru/"}], "areas_of_expertise": [{"name": "Neurology", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Neurology-1-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/expertise/neurology/"}], "locations": [{"name": "Neurology Clinic", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UAMS-Stephens-Institute-12182019-DSC_8129-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/neurology-clinic/"}]}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/anal-cancer/": {"name": "Condition: Anal Cancer", "description": "Anal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the anus.\nThe\u00a0anus\u00a0is the end of the\u00a0large intestine, below the\u00a0rectum, through which\u00a0stool\u00a0(solid waste) leaves the body.

They are connected to each other, with no capillaries. That interferes with the blood circulation in an organ.\nAVMs can happen anywhere, but they are more common in the brain or spinal cord. Most people with brain or spinal cord AVMs have few, if any, major symptoms. Sometimes they can cause seizures or headaches.\nAVMs are rare. The cause of AVMs is unknown, but they seem to develop during pregnancy or soon after birth. Doctors use imaging tests to detect them.\nMedicines can help with the symptoms from AVMs. The greatest danger is hemorrhage. Treatment for AVMs can include surgery or focused radiation therapy. Because surgery can be risky, you and your doctor need to make a decision carefully.\n  NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and StrokeCourtesy of MedlinePlus from the National Library of Medicine.Syndicated Content Details:Source URL: https://medlineplus.gov/arteriovenousmalformations.html?utm_source=mplusconnect&utm_medium=serviceSource Agency: National Library of Medicine", "providers": [{"name": "J.

Your airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma, the inside walls of your airways become sore and swollen. That makes them very sensitive, and they may react strongly to things that you are allergic to or find irritating. When your airways react, they get narrower and your lungs get less air.\nSymptoms of asthma include\n\nWheezing\nCoughing, especially early in the morning or at night\nChest tightness\nShortness of breath\n\nNot all people who have asthma have these symptoms. Having these symptoms doesn't always mean that you have asthma. Your doctor will diagnose asthma based on lung function tests, your medical history, and a physical exam. You may also have allergy tests.\nWhen your asthma symptoms become worse than usual, it's called an asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care, and they can be fatal.\nAsthma is treated with two kinds of medicines: quick-relief medicines to stop asthma symptoms and long-term control medicines to prevent symptoms. \n  NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood InstituteCourtesy of MedlinePlus from the National Library of Medicine.Syndicated Content Details:Source URL: https://medlineplus.gov/asthma.html?utm_source=mplusconnect&utm_medium=serviceSource Agency: National Library of Medicine", "providers": [{"name": "Ariel Berlinski, M.D.", "picture": "/wp-content/plugins/UAMSWP-Find-a-Doc/assets/svg/no-image_3-4.jpg", "specialty": "Pediatric Pulmonologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/ariel-berlinski/"}, {"name": "John L.

Sometimes a physician may use additional laboratory or blood tests as well as a biopsy. Brain tumors may have a variety of symptoms ranging from a mild headache to dangerous symptoms like those of a stroke. Brain tumors can often mimic symptoms of other problems or diseases, so seek professional medical help if you notice symptoms. Different parts of the brain control different body functions, so symptoms will vary depending on the tumor\u2019s location. Symptoms* of a brain tumor can include:\n\nHeadache\nDouble vision, blurred vision or loss of vision\nSeizure\nMemory Loss\nHearing Loss\nUnsteadiness or loss of balance\nChanges in mood, speech, communication or concentration\n\n* Provided by the American Brain Tumor Association.", "providers": [{"name": "J.

Most birth defects happen during the first 3 months of pregnancy. One out of every 33 babies in the United States is born with a birth defect.\nA birth defect may affect how the body looks, works, or both. Some birth defects like cleft lip or neural tube defects are structural problems that can be easy to see. Others, like heart disease, are found using special tests. Birth defects can range from mild to severe. How a birth defect affects a child's life depends mostly on which organ or body part is involved and how severe the defect is.\nWhat causes birth defects?\nFor some birth defects, researchers know the cause. But for many birth defects, the exact cause is unknown. Researchers think that most birth defects are caused by a complex mix of factors, which can include\n\nGenetics. One or more genes might have a change or mutation that prevents them from working properly. For example, this happens in Fragile X syndrome. With some defects, a gene or part of the gene might be missing.\nChromosomal problems. In some cases, a chromosome or part of a chromosome might be missing. This is what happens in Turner syndrome. In other cases, such as with Down syndrome, the child has an extra chromosome. \nExposures to medicines, chemicals, or other toxic substances. For example, alcohol misuse can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.\nInfections during pregnancy. For example, infection with Zika virus during pregnancy can cause a serious defect in the brain.\nLack of certain nutrients. Not getting enough folic acid before and during pregnancy is a key factor in causing neural tube defects.\n\nWho is at risk of having a baby with birth defects?\nCertain factors may might increase the chances of having a baby with a birth defect, such as\n\nSmoking, drinking alcohol, or taking certain \"street\" drugs during pregnancy\nHaving certain medical conditions, such as obesity or uncontrolled diabetes, before and during pregnancy\nTaking certain medicines\nHaving someone in your family with a birth defect. To learn more about your risk of having a baby with a birth defect, you can talk with a genetic counselor,\nBeing an older mother, typically over the age of 34 years\n\nHow are birth defects diagnosed?\nHealth care providers can diagnose some birth defects during pregnancy, using prenatal testing.  That's why it important to get regular prenatal care.\nOther birth defects may not be found until after the baby is born. Providers may find them through newborn screening. Some defects, such as club foot, are obvious right away. Other times, the health care provider may not discover a defect until later in life, when the child has symptoms.\nWhat are the treatments for birth defects?\nChildren with birth defects often need special care and treatments. Because the symptoms and problems caused by birth defects vary, the treatments also vary. Possible treatments may include surgery, medicines, assistive devices, physical therapy, and speech therapy.\nOften, children with birth defects need a variety of services and may need to see several specialists. The primary health care provider can coordinate the special care that the child needs.\nCan birth defects be prevented?\nNot all birth defects can be prevented. But there are things you can do before and during pregnancy to increase your chance of having a healthy baby:\n\nStart prenatal care as soon as you think you might be pregnant, and see your health care provider regularly during pregnancy\nGet 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day. If possible, you should start taking it at least one month before you get pregnant.\nDon't drink alcohol, smoke, or use \"street\" drugs\nTalk to your health care provider about any medicines you are taking or thinking about taking. This includes prescription and over-the-counter medicines, as well as dietary or herbal supplements.\nLearn how to prevent infections during pregnancy\nIf you have any medical conditions, try to get them under control before you get pregnant\n\n  Centers for Disease Control and PreventionCourtesy of MedlinePlus from the National Library of Medicine.Syndicated Content Details:Source URL: https://medlineplus.gov/birthdefects.html?utm_source=mplusconnect&utm_medium=serviceSource Agency: National Library of Medicine", "providers": [], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": []}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/bladder-cancer/": {"name": "Condition: Bladder Cancer", "description": "Bladder cancer, which occurs when there are abnormal, cancerous cells growing in the bladder, affects men three times more than women.

It can also affect the inner foot at the base of the little toe.\nRisk Factors and Symptoms\nBunions most commonly affect women; in fact, bunions are nine times more frequently found in women than men. Wearing narrow-toed, high-heeled shoes can cause a bunion to develop. Tight-fitting shoes can also increase the risk for bunions. They can also be genetic.\nBunions may or may not cause symptoms. Symptoms can include:\n\nRed, calloused skin along the inside edge of the big toe\nBony bump at this site\nPain over the joint, which pressure from shoes can make worse\nBig toe turned toward the other toes\n\nDiagnosis and Approaches to Treatment\nDoctors can diagnose a bunion by a simple physical examination. A foot x-ray may also be done to show an abnormal angle\u00a0between the big toe and the foot.\nTreatment for bunions varies on the individual. It could be simply resting the foot and wearing wider shoes sandals to relieve the pain. If the bunion does not hurt, then treatment may not be necessary. Depending on how bad the bunion is will determine whether or not a procedure is necessary and how invasive it will be.

In all types of cancer, some of the body\u2019s cells begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues.\nCancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.\nWhen cancer develops, however, this orderly process breaks down. As cells become more and more abnormal, old or damaged cells survive when they should die, and new cells form when they are not needed. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form growths called tumors.\nMany cancers form solid tumors, which are masses of tissue. Cancers of the blood, such as leukemias, generally do not form solid tumors.\nCancerous tumors are malignant, which means they can spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. In addition, as these tumors grow, some cancer cells can break off and travel to distant places in the body through the blood or the lymph system and form new tumors far from the original tumor.\nUnlike malignant tumors, benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large, however. When removed, they usually don\u2019t grow back, whereas malignant tumors sometimes do.

Although Castleman Disease is not considered a cancer, it can develop into lymphoma. There are two main types of Castleman Disease: Unicentric, which is localized and affects only a single lymph node region, and Multicentric, which is widespread and affects multiple lymph nodes and lymphatic tissues and which can severely weaken the immune system. Multicentric Castleman Disease can be further classified as either HHH-8 -positive or HHV-8-negative.\nKey Statistics and Risk Factors\nApproximately 6500-7700 new cases of Castleman Disease are diagnosed each year in the U.S. Unicentric Castleman Disease is more common than Multicentric, and can affect children as well as adults. It occurs most frequently in younger females. Multicentric Castleman Disease is more likely to occur in people infected with HIV and in older adults.\nMost patients with Castleman Disease do not have any known risk factors. The only known risk factor for Castleman Disease is infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Multicentric Castleman Disease is much more common in people who are HIV positive. Those who have developed AIDS are more prone to develop Multicentric Castleman Disease because they tend to have weakened immune systems.\nSigns and Symptoms\nCastleman Disease can cause a variety of symptoms, although some people might not have any symptoms at all. Multicentric Castleman Disease usually includes widespread chronic swelling of the lymph nodes and sometimes enlargement of the liver and spleen.\nMany people with Unicentric Castleman Disease experience no symptoms. When symptoms are present, they are usually due to compression of vital structures, such as the trachea, blood vessels or nerves, caused by enlarged lymph nodes.\nWhat are the symptoms of Castleman Disease?\nSymptoms of Unicentric Castleman Disease may include:\n\nA feeling of fullness or pressure in the chest or abdomen that can make breathing or eating difficult\nAn enlarged lump under the skin in the neck, groin or armpit\nFatigue\nFullness in the face\nWeight loss\nCough\nAnemia\n\nMulticentric Castleman Disease\u00a0usually includes widespread, chronic swelling of the lymph nodes.\nThe enlarged nodes can be in the chest or abdomen, groin or the underarm area. When present on the sides of the neck, they can often be seen or felt as lumps under the skin.\nMulticentric Castleman Disease can also affect lymphoid tissue of internal organs, such as the liver or spleen, causing them to enlarge. Enlarged organs might be seen or felt as masses under either side of the rib cage. They can cause a sense of fullness or pain in the abdomen and can interfere with eating.\nSymptoms of Multicentric Castleman Disease may include:\n\nWeakness and fatigue\nNight sweats\nRecurrent fever\nShortness of breath\nNausea and vomiting\nLoss of appetite\nWeight loss\nEnlarged lymph nodes, usually around the neck, collarbone, underarm and groin areas\nEnlarged liver or spleen\n\nDiagnosing Castleman Disease\nIf symptoms or physical exam indicate that a patient might have a lymph node condition, the physician will get a thorough medical history, including details about symptoms, possible risk factors and other medical conditions. The physician will look for infection in the part of the body near the swollen lymph nodes, since infection is the most common cause of swollen\u00a0lymph nodes.\nThe physician will likely order blood work if there is a suspicion of Castleman Disease, some other type of immune system condition, or serious infection. Imaging studies will be performed to look for enlarged lymph nodes or organs that might be causing symptoms. PET scans are helpful for identifying small collections of fast-growing cells that might not be visible with other imaging studies.\nCastleman Disease can only be diagnosed through biopsy (removing an enlarged lymph node) and examination under the microscope.\nTreatment\nIn most cases of Unicentric Castleman Disease, the preferred treatment is surgical removal of the mass. Adjuvant therapy, such as steroids and/or rituximab before surgery, can be useful to shrink a bulky tumor. Unicentric Castleman Disease patients generally do well once the affected lymph node is removed.\nSurgery is not usually an option in the case of Multicentric Castleman Disease because of the number of lymph nodes involved. Treatment generally includes medications and other therapies to control abnormal cell growth. Specific treatment depends on the extent of the disease and on whether there is associated HIV or HHV-8 infection or both.\nTherapy options for HHV-8 positive Multicentric Castleman Disease include:\n\nRituximab, which depletes the reservoir of HHV-8 positive cells and significantly reduces the risk of lymphoma\nEtoposide, a chemotherapeutic agent, for more severely afflicted patients\nMaintenance therapy with valganciclovir, an anti-viral agent\n\nTherapy options for HHV-8 negative Multicentric Castleman Disease include:\n\nSiltuximab or Rituximab. Siltuximab is a monoclonal antibody to the human IL-6 receptor. It is designed to attack a specific target, such as a substance on the surface of lymphocytes, the cells in which Castleman Disease begins.\nImmunosuppressants, immunomodulators, biologics, and cytotoxic chemotherapies, including cyclosporine, sirolimus, bortezomib, thalildomide, anakinra, \u03b1-interferon, cyclophosphamide and etoposide\nAutologous stem cell transplantation\n\nPrognosis\nUnicentric Castleman Disease has an excellent prognosis. It usually does not progress to lymphoma, and surgically removing the tumor cures 90\u201395%\u00a0of cases.\nThe outlook for patients with Multicentric Castleman Disease varies, depending on the specific nature of\u00a0their disease.\nThe Future\nThe introduction of rituximab has been a major advance in HHV-8 positive Multicentric Castleman Disease. Therapy with IL-6-targeting monoclonals, such as siltuximab, has been an important innovation in HHV-8 negative Multicentic Castleman Disease. However, anti-IL-6 monoclonals are not effective for all patients.\nThe Myeloma Center participates with the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network to accelerate research and explore the causes of Multicentric Castleman Disease. The network includes a community of more than 200 researchers worldwide.

It includes labor and delivery. Usually everything goes well, but problems can happen. They may cause a risk to the mother, baby, or both. Some of the more common childbirth problems include\n\nPreterm (premature) labor, when your labor starts before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy\nPremature rupture of membranes (PROM), when your water breaks too early. If labor does not start soon afterwards, this can raise the risk of infection.\nProblems with the placenta, such as the placenta covering the cervix, separating from the uterus before birth, or being attached too firmly to the uterus\nLabor that does not progress, meaning that labor is stalled. This can happen when\n\t\t\nYour contractions weaken\nYour cervix does not dilate (open) enough or is taking too long to dilate\nThe baby is not in the right position\nThe baby is too big or your pelvis is too small for the baby to move through the birth canal\n\n\nAbnormal heart rate of the baby. Often, an abnormal heart rate is not a problem. But if the heart rate gets very fast or very slow, it can be a sign that your baby is not getting enough oxygen or that there are other problems.\nProblems with the umbilical cord, such as the cord getting caught on the baby's arm, leg, or neck. It's also a problem if cord comes out before the baby does.\nProblems with the position of the baby, such as breech, in which the baby is going to come out feet first\nShoulder dystocia, when the baby's head comes out, but the shoulder gets stuck\nPerinatal asphyxia, which happens when the baby does not get enough oxygen in the uterus, during labor or delivery, or just after birth\nPerineal tears, tearing of your vagina and the surrounding tissues\nExcessive bleeding, which can happen when the delivery causes tears to the uterus or if you are not able to deliver the placenta after you give birth to the baby\nPost-term pregnancy, when your pregnancy lasts more than 42 weeks\n\nIf you have problems in childbirth, your health care provider may need to give you medicines to induce or speed up labor, use tools to help guide the baby out of the birth canal, or deliver the baby by Cesarean section.\n  NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human DevelopmentCourtesy of MedlinePlus from the National Library of Medicine.Syndicated Content Details:Source URL: https://medlineplus.gov/childbirthproblems.html?utm_source=mplusconnect&utm_medium=serviceSource Agency: National Library of Medicine", "providers": [], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": []}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/cholesteatoma/": {"name": "Condition: Cholesteatoma", "description": "A cholesteatoma is an abnormal skin growth most commonly found in the area of the middle ear behind the eardrum.

In most cases it is caused by an infection, but this can also be due to decreased nerve sensation.\nCorneal ulcers can happen in people of any age. Risk factors include eyelid margin disease, contact lens wear, trauma, underlying autoimmune disease and uncontrolled diabetes. If not treated, a corneal ulcer can lead to corneal scarring, decreased vision and even blindness.\nWhat causes a corneal ulcer?\n\nBacterial infections, such as Staphylococcus\nViral infections, such as herpes\nFungal infections\nParasitic infections\nScrapes or burns on the cornea\nConditions that dry out the cornea, such as dry eye or Bell\u2019s palsy\nAutoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis\nInjury to the cornea\nUlcers from reduced blood flow, such as from diabetes\nAllergies causing inflammation of the eyes\nVitamin A deficiency (rare in the U.S.)\n\nIf you use contact lenses, you are more at risk for a corneal ulcer if you:\n\nWear soft contact lenses\nWear extended-wear contact lenses\nWear your lenses for longer than recommended\nDon\u2019t\u00a0care for your lenses and lens case as\u00a0advised by your medical team\nPut your contact lenses in water\n\nSymptoms of a corneal ulcer\n\nSevere eye pain\nExcessive Tearing\nPus-like discharge from your eye\nSevere sensitivity to light\nBlurred vision\nEye redness\nSwelling of your eyelids\nA white spot on your cornea\n\nDiagnosing a corneal ulcer\nOne of our experts will\u00a0ask about your past health and your symptoms, and you will be given a thorough medical eye exam. Your eyesight will be checked in both eyes, and a dye may be put into your eye to help your eye doctor look at your cornea. He or she may use an ophthalmoscope, which uses a light to look into the back of your eye. You may be asked to look into a large tool called a slit-lamp so that your eye doctor can see your eye in more detail.\nYour cornea may be scraped and the sample sent to a lab to check for infection. If you wear contact lenses, your contact lenses may be sent to the lab too. You may also have blood tests to help find the cause of your corneal ulcer, and our experts will provide the best personalized treatment for your needs.\nTypes of treatment\n\nEye drops and ointments, such as antibiotic, antiviral or antifungal\nSteroid eye drops\nSerum tear eye drops\nBy mouth antibiotics, antivirals or antifungals\nYour doctor may also give you instructions about protecting your eye as it heals. For example, you may need to wear special contact lens or have your eyelid temporarily closed. Do not wear your normal contact lenses unless your healthcare provider says you can.\nYou may also be treated for the underlying cause of your ulcer, such as dry eye, vitamin deficiency or autoimmune disease. This will help to prevent new ulcers from occurring.\n\nWhat happens if you don\u2019t get treated?\nIf your cornea has damage and scarring, this can harm your eyesight. If not treated right away, a corneal ulcer can lead to severe loss of vision. Treating a corneal ulcer quickly can lower the risk for problems. If the damage to your cornea is severe, you may need other treatments such as:\n\nA special type of contact lens\nEye surgery with a laser (phototherapeutic keratectomy)\nA new cornea (corneal transplantation)\n\nPreventing a corneal ulcer\n\nWear protective eyewear when doing any activity that might lead to eye injury.\nTreat health conditions that may lead to corneal ulcers, such as severe dry eyes, autoimmune disease, exposure of the cornea.\nIf you wear contact lenses make sure that they fit well, clean them regularly, do not sleep in them and replace them at their scheduled time. Never reuse lens solution or use homemade lens solution.", "providers": [{"name": "Kathryn L. \"Katie\" Brown, O.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12141/Brown_Kathryn-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Optometrist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/kathryn-l-brown/"}, {"name": "Megan K.

Most people feel that way at one point in their lives for short periods of time. However, true clinical depression is a mood disorder where feelings of sadness, loss, anger or frustration interfere with everyday life for weeks or longer.\nDepression Symptoms\nSome people experience symptoms so severe that it\u2019s clear something isn\u2019t right; for others, people feel generally miserable but aren\u2019t sure why. Symptoms for depression include:\n\nPersistent sad, anxious or empty feeling\nFeelings of hopelessness, worthlessness and helplessness\nLoss of interest or pleasure in hobbies or activities you once enjoyed\nFatigue and lack of energy\nInsomnia or excessive sleeping\nSignificant change in appetite/ weight loss or gain\nThoughts of\u00a0suicide\n\nDepression\u00a0could be caused by abuse, medication, a major life event, death or loss of a loved one or serious illnesses. A family history of depression also may increase the risk.\nTypes of Depression\nAll depression types are not the same. The two most common types are\u00a0major depression and chronic depression (dysthymia). Major depression affects your ability to work, study, eat, sleep and enjoy pleasurable activities. These symptoms cause significant distress and prevent you from functioning normally. With major depression, the symptoms cannot be due to direct effects of a substance (medication or drug abuse), medical condition or recent loss of a loved one.\nChronic depression is characterized by long-term (two years or more) depressed mood. This depression is less severe than major depression, and symptoms don\u2019t typically prevent normal functioning. However, people with chronic depression may experience one or more episodes of major depression during their lifetimes.\nFor a diagnosis of\u00a0depression, your doctor will talk to you about recent moods and behaviors and may conduct a physical examination. The most common treatments of depression are medication and psychotherapy.", "providers": [{"name": "Mary Denise Compton, Ph.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/11854/Compton_Denise-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Psychologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/mary-denise-compton/"}, {"name": "Caris Talburt Fitzgerald, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/917067/Fitzgerald_Caris-Talburt-1-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Sleep Medicine Physician", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/caris-talburt-fitzgerald/"}, {"name": "Shona L.

The glucose remains in the blood causing high blood glucose, also known as hyperglycemia. Without the insulin, your body cannot use glucose or the energy it supplies.\nCauses of Type 1 Diabetes\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease.\u00a0 This means that your own body make antibodies against itself, causing gradual damage to an organ \u2013 in this case, the pancreas.\u00a0 Gradual destruction of the pancreas, more specifically the islet cells which make insulin, causes the manifestations of the disease.\nType 1 diabetes has a genetic component meaning that there are families in which multiple generations will be diagnosed with the same disease.\u00a0 For most people however, when they are diagnosed, there may be no other relatives with the disease.\u00a0 If you take a thorough history however you may find that other autoimmune diseases run in the family such as thyroid disease, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, or adrenal insufficiency.\nUnlike type 2 diabetes, there is no relationship between diet and weight and the development of type 1 diabetes.\nSymptoms of Type 1 Diabetes\nEach person may experience the symptoms of type 1 diabetes differently, however unlike type 2 diabetes, the onset of symptoms appears more abrupt and severe. The most common symptoms include but are not limited to:\n\nIncreased thirst\nFrequent urination\nWeight loss despite not adhering to a strict diet or exercise regimen\nFrequent bladder or skin infections\nBlurred vision\nNausea and vomiting\nExtreme weakness and fatigue\nCuts or injuries that heal slowly\n\nManaging Your Type 1 Diabetes\nIf you are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes you must take insulin.\u00a0 Most people with type 1 diabetes take 2 types: a long acting (basal) insulin once daily and a rapid acting (bolus) insulin with each meal.\u00a0 It is very important not to miss any doses of either type of insulin otherwise you can experience very high blood glucose levels and become very ill.\nSome people with type 1 diabetes use insulin pumps which are attached to the abdomen and allow the user to deliver precise amounts of insulin to manage their carbohydrate (sugar) intake and to correct for high blood sugars.\nMany people with type 1 diabetes use continuous glucose monitors (CGM) to track their blood sugars, increase awareness of high and low blood sugars, and allow them and their providers to better see their glucose trend information.\nFollow Up for Type 1 Diabetes \nMost patients with type 1 diabetes will need to see a specialist in diabetes (an endocrinologist) every 3 months. At these visits, their glucose meter, pump, and/or continuous glucose monitor can be downloaded and insulin doses adjusted.\u00a0 They should bring all of their devices to each visit.\nThey will also want to discuss screening for eye, kidney, nerve, and heart disease and make sure all lab testing is up to date.\nIndividuals with Type 1 diabetes should remember to get regular vaccinations, to never smoke tobacco, and to work closely with their endocrinologist if pregnancy is desired to ensure health for both mother and baby.\nYou should work with your doctor to determine what to do if you are sick (come up with a \u201csick day plan\u201d) or if your insulin pump is not working (a \u201cback up plan).\u00a0 You should also be aware of how to use glucagon, a hormone that can be given in the case of a severe hypoglycemic reaction.\nRemember that type 1 diabetes is a serious medical condition, but if you work closely with your diabetes team, there is no reason that it has to restrict you from any work, school, or life plan that you choose.", "providers": [{"name": "Ashley  N.

Insulin is a hormone that removes glucose from the bloodstream.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t make enough of it or are resistant to it, your blood glucose (sugar) will be too high. Elevated blood glucose over time can lead to damage to the blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, fat, liver and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. Early on in type 2 diabetes, the body is able to compensate for this resistance by making more insulin but this ability decreases over time.\nCauses of Type 2 Diabetes\nThere is not a single cause of type 2 diabetes.\u00a0 There are many genetic, social, and environmental factors that play a role.\u00a0 While you can inherit a tendency to develop the condition, excessive weight gain and/or physical inactivity can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\u00a0 Studies have shown that controlling your body weight, eating a healthy diet, and regular exercise can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes even in those who are genetically predisposed.\nRisk Factors and Symptoms for Type 2 Diabetes\nRisk factors for type 2 diabetes include but are not limited to the following:\n\nAge \u2013 those 45 or older are at a higher risk\nFamily history of diabetes\nBeing overweight (body mass index of >25 kg/m2 or >23 kg/m2 in Asian Americans)\nPhysical inactivity\nRace and ethnicity \u2013 African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and American Indians are at a higher risk\nHistory of\u00a0gestational diabetes\nHistory of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)\nA low\u00a0HDL level\nA high\u00a0triglyceride level\n\nEach person may experience the symptoms of type 2 diabetes differently. Often, those with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms at first and may not for many years. The most common symptoms include but are not limited to:\n\nIncreased thirst\nFrequent urination\nWeight loss despite not adhering to a strict diet or exercise regimen\nFrequent bladder or skin infections\nBlurred vision\nNausea and vomiting\nExtreme weakness and fatigue\nIrritability and mood changes\nDry, itchy skin\nTingling or loss of feeling in the hands or feet\nCuts or injuries that heal slowly\n\nManaging Your Type 2 Diabetes\nOften, type 2 diabetes can be controlled through weight loss, improved nutrition and exercise alone. However, in some cases, these measures are not enough and oral or injected medications are necessary.\nTreatment often includes:\n\nLower carbohydrate diet\nExercise program (150 minutes of moderate physical activity weekly)\nGradual weight loss (goal is 5-10% weight loss if you are overweight or obese)\nMedications\nRegular follow up with your primary care doctor and eye doctor (ophthalmologist) and possibly a nutritionist or diabetes educator, an endocrinologist who specializes in diabetes, kidney doctor (nephrologist), foot doctor (podiatrist), and heart doctor (cardiologist)\n\nTo prevent type 2 diabetes, especially if you have been diagnosed previously with pre-diabetes or \u201cborderline\u201d diabetes, it is important to keep a healthy body weight and an active lifestyle.", "providers": [{"name": "Ashley  N.

Three out of four children will have at least one ear infection by their third birthday.  Adults can also get ear infections, but they are less common.\nThe infection usually affects the middle ear and is called otitis media. The tubes inside the ears become clogged with fluid and mucus. This can affect hearing, because sound cannot get through all that fluid.\nIf your child isn't old enough to say \"My ear hurts,\" here are a few things to look for\n\nTugging at ears\nCrying more than usual\nFluid draining from the ear\nTrouble sleeping\nBalance difficulties\nHearing problems\n\nYour health care provider will diagnose an ear infection by looking inside the ear with an instrument called an otoscope.\nOften, ear infections go away on their own. Your health care provider may recommend pain relievers. Severe infections and infections in young babies may require antibiotics. \nChildren who get infections often may need surgery to place small tubes inside their ears. The tubes relieve pressure in the ears so that the child can hear again.\n  NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders Courtesy of MedlinePlus from the National Library of Medicine.Syndicated Content Details:Source URL: https://medlineplus.gov/earinfections.html?utm_source=mplusconnect&utm_medium=serviceSource Agency: National Library of Medicine", "providers": [], "areas_of_expertise": [{"name": "Hearing and Balance", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Hearing-and-Balance-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/expertise/hearing-and-balance/"}, {"name": "Primary Care", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/primary-care-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/expertise/primary-care/"}], "locations": [{"name": "Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) Clinic", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UAMS-Stephens-Institute-12182019-DSC_8129-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/ear-nose-and-throat-clinic/"}, {"name": "Student Health Clinic", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Bruce-fountain-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/student-health-clinic/"}]}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/ear-nose-and-throat-disorders/": {"name": "Condition: Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders", "description": "", "providers": [{"name": "Jennings Russell Boyette, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12004/Boyette_Jennings-Russell-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Otolaryngologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/jennings-russell-boyette/"}, {"name": "Alissa Kanaan, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12176/Kanaan_Alissa-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Otolaryngologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/alissa-kanaan/"}, {"name": "G.

Some patients may experience pain, fever, night sweats or weight loss.\nDiagnosing EMD\nEMD may be present at the time of initial diagnosis as evidenced on baseline imaging studies such as positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Or, it can develop at the time of disease relapse, when it is commonly found in the liver, lungs and lymph nodes.\nEMD is diagnosed when a biopsy of the suspected area reveals the presence of malignant plasma cells.\nTreatment\nMyeloma relapse or disease progression resulting in EMD occurs in a variety of clinical circumstances and therefore requires individualized treatment. Multiple myeloma patients who develop EMD are usually treated with the same therapies used to treat myeloma that is found only in the bone marrow:\n\nChemotherapy agents, such as cisplatin, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide\nProteosome inhibitors, such as Velcade\u00ae (bortezomib)\nImmunomodulatory agents, such as Revlimid\u00ae (lenalidomide) and thalidomide\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation\nKyprolis\u00ae (carfilzomib) and Imnovid\u00ae (pomalidomide) for those whose disease isrefractory to Velcade and Revlimid\nOther novel agents\n\nPrognosis\nResearch has shown that myeloma patients with extramedullary disease have a poorer prognosis than those without. However, when taking survival statistics into account, patients should remember that these rates are rough estimates. Patients with plasma cell leukemia secondary to myeloma should consult with their doctors about their specific situation and prognosis.\nFuture\nEMD is a poor prognostic marker in both newly diagnosed and relapsed myeloma patients and, therefore, is a therapeutic challenge even with the use of novel agents. Researchers are investigating the frequency of EMD in relapsing myeloma when novel agents are employed and whether combination of agents might be beneficial. A better understanding of how myeloma cells grow and thrive, as well as the biology of extramedullary tumors, is needed in order to develop better strategies for the treatment of EMD.\nScientific research is continuously evolving, leading to discovery of new treatments and improvements to current treatments. Therefore, it is important that patients consult with their physicians about updates in treatment regimens.", "providers": [{"name": "Carolina Schinke, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12155/Schinke_Carolina-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/carolina-d-schinke/"}, {"name": "Sharmilan Thanendrarajan, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12242/Thanendrarajan_Sharmilan-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/sharmilan-thanendrarajan/"}, {"name": "Frits van Rhee, M.D., Ph.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/11206/van-Rhee_Frits-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/frits-van-rhee/"}, {"name": "Maurizio Zangari, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12152/Zangari_Maurizio-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/maurizio-zangari/"}], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": [{"name": "Myeloma Center", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cancer-institute-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/myeloma-center/"}]}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/eye-diseases/": {"name": "Condition: Eye Diseases", "description": "", "providers": [{"name": "Joseph G.

This is due to spasms of the bladder muscles.\nOverflow incontinence\u00a0is when you can\u2019t empty your bladder every time you go to the bathroom and may have leakage once the bladder is full. Weak bladder muscles, tumors and urinary stones can be causes for this type. This type is rarer in women.\n\nYou should seek treatment for incontinence when it becomes bothersome to you and affects your daily life.

At first, the issues may only occur occasionally when you are wearing narrow-toed shoes or performing certain activities that may irritate your feet. The symptoms may even go away temporarily when you take your shoe off and or massage your foot. Many times there is no outward sign of this condition.\nSymptoms include:\n\nTingling, burning or numbness\nPain\nA feeling that something is inside the ball of the foot\nA feeling that there\u2019s something in the shoe or a sock is bunched up\n\nYour doctor will examine your foot to see if there is a mass or tender spot in your foot. There could be a feeling of \u201cclicking\u201d between the bones of your foot. Most of the time, you will have an x-ray to diagnose the neuroma.\nIf you have a neuroma,\u00a0surgery\u00a0may be needed.

During pregnancy, levels of certain hormones in your bloodstream increase, causing blood glucose levels to rise higher than normal.\nNormally, the pancreas produces extra insulin to move the glucose from your bloodstream into your cells. This keeps the blood glucose in a healthy range. Gestational diabetes when your pancreas cannot make enough insulin and the glucose stays in your bloodstream, leading to high blood glucose or hyperglycemia.\nCauses of Gestational Diabetes\nGestational diabetes is caused by elevated hormones of pregnancy which cause resistance to the insulin produced by the body. This insulin resistance increases as the pregnancy progresses and the mother, baby, and placenta continue to grow.\nRisk Factors and Symptoms for Gestational Diabetes \nRisk factors for gestational diabetes include but are not limited to the following:\n\nBeing overweight\nPhysical inactivity\nHistory of gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy\nHistory of 9 lb baby from a previous pregnancy\nHigh blood pressure\nHistory of heart disease\nHistory of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)\nAfrican American, Asian American, Hispanic, Native American, or Pacific Island background\n\nMost commonly, individuals with gestational diabetes experience no symptoms or only very mild ones. As glucose levels rise, symptoms can mimic those of type 2 diabetes.\u00a0 These include but are not limited to:\n\nIncreased thirst\nFrequent urination\nFrequent bladder or skin infections\nBlurred vision\nWeakness and fatigue\n\nEffects of Gestational Diabetes\nBecause of high blood sugar levels in a mother, the fetus also experiences these levels. This can lead to high insulin levels and excessive weight gain of the fetus. A larger baby can lead to complications with delivery for the mother such as labor difficulties, increased need for cesarean section, heavy bleeding with delivery, and vaginal tears during normal delivery.\nMothers with gestational diabetes also have higher rates of hypertension (high blood pressure) and preeclampsia which can lead to preterm labor and premature delivery.\nScreening for Gestational Diabetes\nAll women are screened for gestational diabetes by 24-28 weeks of pregnancy with a glucose tolerance test or sooner if certain risk factors are present.\nManaging Your Gestational Diabetes\nIf you have gestational diabetes it is important to follow up closely with your obstetrician and possibly an endocrinologist or maternal-fetal medicine specialist.\nYou will need to monitor your blood glucose levels using a finger-stick glucometer and work on your diet and exercise program and control your weight gain during pregnancy. You should eat 3 small meals and 2-3 small snacks throughout the day to keep blood glucose levels stable.\nYou should try to exercise for 150 minutes per week. For some, a good way to do this is to walk for 10-15 minutes after each meal.\nIf you require medication for gestational diabetes to achieve your blood glucose targets, insulin is the safest option for both mother and baby. You should talk to your doctor about the type and dosing that is best for you.", "providers": [{"name": "Elena Ambrogini, M.D., Ph.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12218/Ambrogini_Elena-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Endocrinologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/elena-ambrogini/"}, {"name": "Nancy Andrews Collins, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/54674/Collins_Nancy-Andrews-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Obstetrician/Gynecologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/nancy-andrews-collins/"}, {"name": "Nafisa K.

The head is one of the most common sites of pain in the body. The pain can be isolated to a certain location or move across the head from one point to another. It can be in the form of sharp pain, a throbbing sensation or just dull ache lasting from hours to even a few days. A headache is technically defined as a pain coming from the head or upper neck of the body.\nTypes of Headaches\nThe types of headaches are classified as primary, secondary or cranial neuralgias, facial pain or other headaches. A primary headache is not the symptom of an underlying issue, but just a problem caused by overactivity of pain-sensitive structures in your head. They can be triggered by lifestyle factors like stress, changes in sleep or nutrition. There are several types of primary headaches:\n\nTension headaches are the most common and occur more in women than men. The cause is not always understood but it is generally a diffuse, mild to moderate pain in your head.\nMigraine headaches affect children and adults. It is an intense throbbing or a pulsing sensation in one area of the head. It also can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound.\nCluster headache is a rare type of primary headache and it is one of the most painful. It normally affects men in their late 20s and occurs in cyclical patterns or clusters.\n\nSecondary headaches are those caused by an underlying issue with the head or neck. It includes a wide range of medical conditions from dental to sinus to infections. This category also includes traumatic headaches like post-concussion headaches.\nThe final type is cranial neuralgia which describes inflammation of one of the 12 nerves that supply the motor and sensation function of the head and neck.\nSeeing Your Doctor About Your Headache\nA headache is often not something to be concerned about or see your doctor. However, see a doctor if the headache is accompanied by:\n\nConfusion or trouble understanding speech\nFainting\nHigh fever\nTrouble seeing or walking\nNumbness, weakness or paralysis\n\nAlso, see your doctor if you experience headaches more frequently than usual or if they become more severe. If the headache interferes with your normal activities and worsen with over-the-counter drugs, you should also make an appointment with your doctor.", "providers": [{"name": "Dale  M.

A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart suddenly becomes blocked. Without the blood coming in, the heart can't get oxygen. If not treated quickly, the heart muscle begins to die. But if you do get quick treatment, you may be able to prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle. That's why it's important to know the symptoms of a heart attack and call 911 if you or someone else is having them. You should call, even if you are not sure that it is a heart attack.\nThe most common symptoms in men and women are\n\nChest discomfort. It is often in center or left side of the chest. It usually lasts more than a few minutes. It may go away and come back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion.\nShortness of breath. Sometimes this is your only symptom. You may get it before or during the chest discomfort. It can happen when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity.\nDiscomfort in the upper body. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach.\n\nYou may also have other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and lightheadedness. You may break out in a cold sweat. Sometimes women will have different symptoms then men. For example, they are more likely to feel tired for no reason.\nThe most common cause of heart attacks is coronary artery disease (CAD). With CAD, there is a buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls or the arteries. This is atherosclerosis. It can build up for years. Eventually an area of plaque can rupture (break open). A blood clot can form around the plaque and block the artery.\nA less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery.\nAt the hospital, health care providers make a diagnosis based on your symptoms, blood tests, and different heart health tests. Treatments may include medicines and medical procedures such as coronary angioplasty. After a heart attack, cardiac rehabilitation and lifestyle changes can help you recover.\n  NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood InstituteCourtesy of MedlinePlus from the National Library of Medicine.Syndicated Content Details:Source URL: https://medlineplus.gov/heartattack.html?utm_source=mplusconnect&utm_medium=serviceSource Agency: National Library of Medicine", "providers": [{"name": "Jay K.

Even within a family, symptoms vary greatly and include:\n\nSevere nosebleeds\nRed splotches on the skin, especially the fingertips\n\nPatients with HHT may have blood clots in various areas of the body, including the lungs, which may be very dangerous if left untreated. At academic medical centers like UAMS, our team includes a number of caring and compassionate specialists who can perform procedures that are minimally or noninvasive. One of only a few HHT centers in the U.S, we help our patients control this condition and lead a relatively normal life.\nIn addition to treatment for HHT, UAMS geneticists offer genetic testing to ensure that family members who do not have HHT are not subjected to unnecessary tests or procedures.", "providers": [], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": [{"name": "Interventional Radiology Clinic \u2014 Outpatient Center", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UAMS-Outpatient-Center-12182019-DSC_8127-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/interventional-radiology-clinic/"}]}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/hernia/": {"name": "Condition: Hernia", "description": "", "providers": [{"name": "Janina B.

The pressure is the highest when the\u00a0heart\u00a0beats and pumps blood into the vessels, and the pressure is the lowest in between beats when the heart relaxes.\nYou must have your\u00a0blood pressure numbers\u00a0recorded in order to know if you have high blood pressure or hypertension. There are two numbers recorded, the top number and the bottom number. The top number, or systolic pressure, refers to the pressure inside the artery when the heart pumps blood through the body. The bottom number, or diastolic pressure, refers to the pressure inside the artery when the heart is at rest.\nA 120/80 or lower is considered a normal blood pressure reading. A 140/90 or higher is considered a high reading. A systolic reading between 120 and 139 and a diastolic reading between 80 and 89 is considered high or prehypertension.\nRisks Factors\nNearly one-third of all Americans have high blood pressure, but those who are at most risk include:\n\nPeople with diabetes, gout or kidney disease\nPeople with a family history of high blood pressure\nAfrican Americans, particularly those in the southeastern United States\nMen in their early to middle adult years\nWomen in their middle to later adult years, particularly after menopause\nPeople age 60 and older\nWomen who take oral contraceptives\n\nOther factors that can cause high blood pressure include:\n\nObesity\nExcessive sodium intake\nA lack of physical activity\nExcessive alcohol consumption\n\nHigh blood pressure increases the risk of\u00a0coronary heart disease,\u00a0heart attack\u00a0and\u00a0stroke. Because there are usually no signs or symptoms of high blood pressure, the best way to know if your blood pressure is high is to have it checked regularly. You can have it checked by your doctor or health care provider, or you can\u00a0check it yourself at home\u00a0with an electronic blood pressure monitor.\nControlling High Blood Pressure\nHigh blood usually can be controlled through\u00a0lifestyle changes. However, some people may have to take medication daily and check their blood pressure routinely.\nWays you can control high blood pressure include:\n\nEating foods low in sodium, calories and fat\nEating foods high in fiber\nMaintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if required\nEating smaller portions of food\nIncreasing physical activity\nReducing or limiting alcohol", "providers": [{"name": "Alice P.

A number of conditions and issues can contribute to infertility in men and women.\nFemale Infertility\nApproximately 10 percent of women in the United States ages 15-44 have difficulty getting pregnant or staying pregnant. In most cases, infertility issues are caused by problems with ovulation. If you have irregular or absent menstrual periods, this could be an indication that you are not ovulating normally. This could be caused by polycystic ovary syndrome, blocked fallopian tubes or problems with the uterus.\nOther existing medical conditions may also play a role in your fertility. In some cases, thyroid disorders can interrupt your menstrual cycle or cause infertility. If you have been diagnosed with cancer and have undergone treatment, this can also impair fertility. Other medical issues that delayed puberty or have created an absence of menstruation, like diabetes, celiac disease, Cushing\u2019s disease or kidney disease, can also affect fertility.\nAge definitely plays a role in female fertility. An older woman\u2019s eggs aren\u2019t fertilized as easily as a younger woman\u2019s eggs. She has a smaller number of eggs left, and they are not as healthy.\nHow to Address Infertility\nSeveral common medications can help treat infertility. These medications often help women who have ovulation problems. They can, however, increase the chance of having twins, triplets or other multiples.\nSeveral factors can change your ability to have a baby, and some are within your control:\n\nMaintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or significantly underweight can affect hormone production and prevent normal ovulation. Staying within a healthy weight range will increase your chance of getting pregnant.\nEat a healthy, well-balanced diet. While there are no specific foods that will increase your likelihood of conceiving, good nutrition is an important part of preconception care. You should also be sure to include a daily prenatal vitamin that contains folic acid.\nManage stress. Research has shown that stress can lower the odds of conception. Try to avoid high-stress situations or practice stress-reducing techniques that allow you to unwind.\nDon\u2019t miss your regular checkups. If you make regular visitors to your doctor, he/she can help you detect or manage any existing health conditions that could play a role in your fertility.\n\nIf you are concerned about getting pregnant, don\u2019t forget to take care of yourself. You want to create a healthy environment for your baby for nine months.\nMale Infertility\nIn approximately half of all infertility cases, male infertility plays a role.\nMale infertility is typically determined by a semen analysis. A specialist will evaluate the number of sperm, how they are shaped and how they move. A semen analysis can be slightly abnormal, and the male still be fertile. However, the analysis helps determine the cause of infertility and what can be done to treat it.\nCauses of Male Infertility\nProblems with male fertility can be caused by a variety of issues:\n\nExisting medical conditions, such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis, trauma, infection, testicular failure or treatment with chemotherapy or radiation\nVaricoceles is a condition in which there is swelling of the veins that drain the testicle. It can lead to reduced sperm count and fewer moving sperm.\nInfections (including sexually-transmitting infections) can interfere with sperm count or cause scarring that blocks the sperm.\nUnhealthy habits, such as smoking, heavy alcohol use, testosterone supplementation, steroid use and illicit drug use.\nEnvironmental toxins including exposure to pesticides and lead.\nChromosome defects can lead to abnormal development of male reproductive organs.\n\nMale infertility can be treated with medical, surgical or assisted reproductive therapies depending on the exact cause. Even if an exact cause is not clear, your doctor may be able to recommend treatments that help.", "providers": [{"name": "Gloria A.

Acute can last from one night to a few weeks. With chronic insomnia, you have sleep issues for at least three nights a week for a month or longer.\nSeveral symptoms accompany insomnia, including:\n\nDifficulty falling asleep\nWaking up often during the night and having trouble going back to sleep\nWaking up too early in the morning\nFeeling tired upon waking\nSleepiness during the day\n\nThere are two different types of insomnia: primary and secondary. Primary insomnia is when you have sleep problems that are not directly associated with any other health condition. Secondary insomnia is when you have sleep issues because of another condition, medication or substance.\nDiagnosis and Treatments for Insomnia\nOur doctors at UAMS can help diagnose your insomnia. You may be asked to keep a sleep diary for a week or two, tracking your sleep patterns and how you feel during the day. You may be required to have extra testing such as a\u00a0sleep study.\nTreatment for insomnia differs for each individual condition. Acute insomnia may not require treatment and can be prevented or cure by good sleep habits. Treatment for chronic insomnia depends on whether there are any underlying health conditions that are causing insomnia.\nNo matter what type or the severity of your insomnia, our doctors at UAMS can help.

This rash is characterized by small, flat-topped, many-sided bumps that can grow together into rough, scaly patches on the skin. The main difference between lichen planus and other common rashes is the violet color that is characteristic of lichen planus.\nThe onset of lichen planus can be sudden or gradual. The first attack can last weeks or months with recurrences happening for years. Children are not affected by this disorder.\nErosive lichen planus may be painful in the mouth and vagina, and secondary infections may occur. If the affected areas touch one another, scarring may occur, resulting in a narrowing or complete closure of the vagina.\nApproaches to Treating Lichen Planus\nSeveral medications are used to treat this disorder, and lichen planus often improves with various creams and ointments. For localized, itchy, thick lesions, injections of corticosteroids may be given. Antihistamines may help treat the itch, especially if it is only moderate. In more severe cases, your doctors may recommend oral medications. Sometimes the bumps will disappear without treatment; however, treatment can make your skin look better.\nSince lichen planus closely resembles other skin conditions, it is diagnosed by a\u00a0biopsy.

Mostly affecting the genital and anal areas, this vulvar disorder can occur at any age. The exact cause of lichen sclerosus is unknown. But we do know that this is not an infection that you caught from anyone, and you also cannot give it to others.\nEarly in the disease, small, white spots appear on the skin. These spots are usually shiny and smooth. Later, the spots grow into bigger patches, and the skin on the patches becomes thin and crinkles. Then the skin tears easily, and bright red or purple bruises are common. Other symptoms can include:\n\nItching\nDiscomfort or pain\nBleeding\nBlisters\n\nDiagnosis and Treatment\nOur highly qualified doctors can perform a physical\u00a0examination to diagnose lichen sclerosus; however, we will usually perform a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. This\u00a0biopsy\u00a0is a minor surgical procedure to remove a small piece of tissue that is then examined.\nTreatment generally includes using a strong cortisone cream or ointment on the skin. The goal of the treatment is to eliminate itching and protect the skin from damage. Occasionally, complete resolution of the abnormal vulvar appearance may occur. More commonly, skin changes of the lichen sclerosus will not completely resolve. This does not mean that the treatments are not helping. Various medications are used to improve the skin condition.\nLichen sclerosus does not cause\u00a0skin cancer, but skin that is scarred by lichen sclerosus is more likely to develop skin cancer.

Plasma cells, found in the bone marrow and in blood, normally produce antibodies that fight infection.\nThe abnormal protein is referred to as an M\u2013protein or paraprotein. It is monoclonal, which means that it is produced by one family of cells that are all identical copies of each other.\nMGUS is considered a benign condition, since there is only a small risk that it will develop into myeloma or a related blood cancer. An increase in paraprotein in the bone marrow is often the first sign of progression from MGUS to active myeloma. This excess of the paraprotein impedes the production of healthy blood cells and antibodies that fight infection.\n\nKey Statistics and Risk Factors\nThe risk of MGUS increases with age. Approximately 3% of adults 50 and older and 5% of adults 70 and older have M-protein in their blood. The highest incidence is among adults 85 and older.\nMGUS is about 1.5 times more common in men than in women and is nearly twice as common in African-Americans as in Caucasians.\nSigns and Symptoms\nThere are usually no obvious symptoms associated with MGUS. Occasionally, people with MGUS have numbness or tingling in their hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy), or problems with their balance. This may be due to nerve damage caused by the paraprotein in the blood.\nPatients with MGUS should watch for any symptoms, such as bone pain and fatigue, as they might indicate progression to myeloma.\nDiagnosing MGUS\nMGUS is usually detected incidentally during a routine check-up when a blood test shows an increase in the blood protein level. The diagnosis is then confirmed by having a particular blood test called serum electropheresis which identifies the abnormal antibody.\nMGUS is clinically defined as having a paraprotein level of less than 3 grams per deciliter and less than 10 percent plasma cells in the bone marrow. There is no damage to bones, calcium levels are normal, little or no protein is present in the urine, kidney function is normal and there is no anemia (which can result from a low red blood cell count).\nTreatment\nMGUS does not usually require treatment. In most people, MGUS remains stable and does not ever cause any problems. However, because MGUS can develop into myeloma, regular check-ups are important.\nResearch at the Myeloma Center suggests that some patients with MGUS are at increased risk for progression to myeloma. Risk is based on clinical variables, such as blood protein levels and results of gene expression profiling and magnetic resonance imaging. In some cases, treatment aimed at preventing progression to active myeloma is indicated.\nPrognosis\nMGUS is generally considered benign and has no ill effects on overall health or survival. However, regular check-ups are essential, since myeloma typically develops in 1% to 2% of MGUS patients per year. It is important for patients to contact their doctor between check-ups if they develop any new symptoms.\nFuture\nOur expert scientists at the Myeloma Center are researching what causes the progression of MGUS to myeloma, the genetics of MGUS and myeloma and whether personalized treatment may prevent the progression.", "providers": [{"name": "Carolina Schinke, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12155/Schinke_Carolina-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/carolina-d-schinke/"}, {"name": "Sharmilan Thanendrarajan, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12242/Thanendrarajan_Sharmilan-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/sharmilan-thanendrarajan/"}, {"name": "Frits van Rhee, M.D., Ph.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/11206/van-Rhee_Frits-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/frits-van-rhee/"}, {"name": "Maurizio Zangari, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12152/Zangari_Maurizio-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/maurizio-zangari/"}], "areas_of_expertise": [{"name": "Cancer Care", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cancer-care-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/expertise/cancer-care/"}], "locations": [{"name": "Myeloma Center", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cancer-institute-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/myeloma-center/"}]}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/mood-disorders/": {"name": "Condition: Mood Disorders", "description": "", "providers": [{"name": "Michael A.

Multiple births are up in the United States.  More women are having babies after age 30 and more are taking fertility drugs. Both boost the chance of carrying more than one baby. A family history of twins also makes multiples more likely.\nYears ago, most twins came as a surprise. Now, most women know about a multiple pregnancy early. Women with multiple pregnancies should see their health care providers more often than women who are expecting one baby. Multiple pregnancy babies have a much higher risk of being born prematurely and having a low birth weight.  There is also more of a risk of disabilities. Some women have to go on bed rest to delay labor. Finally, they may deliver by C-section, especially if there are three babies or more.\nParenting multiples can be a challenge.

It develops in the bone marrow, the soft, spongy tissue in the center of large bones where most blood cells are produced.\nPlasma cells are white blood cells that are part of the immune system. They produce antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, to help fight infection. In myeloma, plasma cells become abnormal and transform into cancerous myeloma cells. As they multiply, they crowd out and interfere with production of normal, healthy cells.\nLow levels of red blood cells can result in anemia, characterized by weakness and fatigue; low levels of platelets can lead to increased bleeding and bruising; low levels of normal white blood cells can diminish the body\u2019s ability to fight infections.\nMyeloma cells tend to collect in groups scattered throughout the skeleton \u2013 typically in the bones of the spine, skull, pelvis, rib cage, shoulders and hips. Therefore, the disease is often referred to as multiple myeloma.\nUnlike normal plasma cells, myeloma cells release only one type of antibody, a monoclonal protein known as M protein or paraprotein. When this monoclonal protein is measured in blood and urine it is referred to as an M-spike; it is an indicator of disease activity, and similarly, can be an indicator of response to treatment. Some patients do not produce any monoclonal protein, in which case presence of disease must be assessed by different methods.\nMyeloma cells prevent bone cells from forming new bone and increase the absorption of bone already laid down, resulting in weak, thin bones characterized by holes (resembling holes in Swiss cheese) or \u201clytic lesions.\u201d These lytic lesions can cause significant bone pain and increase the risk of fractures. Myeloma can also cause calcium to leave the bones and enter the bloodstream, resulting in what is known as hypercalcemia, which can cause nausea, fatigue and confusion.\nWho gets Myeloma?\nMultiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer and accounts for approximately 12% of all hematologic cancers and 1.4% of all cancers. About 114,000 new cases globally and 25,000 new cases in the United States are diagnosed each year.\nIn the United States, the lifetime risk of getting multiple myeloma is 1 in 143, or 0.7%. The risk of multiple myeloma increases as people age. Most people diagnosed are at least 65 years old. The disease is rare in people younger than 35. Men are more likely to develop multiple myeloma than women. It is more common in African Americans than in white Americans.\nThe risk of developing myeloma is also higher among those with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). MGUS occurs in about 1% of the general population and in about 3% of healthy individuals older than 70 years. MGUS is a benign condition that does not require treatment. However, MGUS often progresses to multiple myeloma at a rate of 1% per year.\nWhat causes Myeloma?\nThe causes of myeloma are not known, but the interaction of patients\u2019 inherited genetic and environmental factors is thought to play a role. Researchers at the Myeloma Center are exploring the biology of myeloma to better understand the impact of genetics and the environment.\nWhat are the symptoms of myeloma?\nSymptoms of myeloma may include:\n\nBone pain, usually in the back and chest\nBroken bones, usually in the spine\nWeakness or numbness in the legs\nFatigue\nFrequent Infections\nWeight loss\nNausea\nExcessive thirst\nFogginess or confusion\n\nEarly stage of myeloma may not exhibit any symptoms.\nHow is Myeloma diagnosed?\nMyeloma can be difficult to diagnose because many of the symptoms are not specific only to myeloma. Sometimes myeloma is first indicated by an abnormality found during routine blood work or results of an X-ray for a broken bone. A full series of diagnostic tests is required, as is a thorough history and physical exam, in order to make a definitive diagnosis.\nDiagnostic testing at the Myeloma Center may include:\nComplete Blood Profile identifies counts of white cells, red cells and platelets and other indicators of blood composition. Blood profile results can indicate the quality of bone marrow, kidney function and liver function.\nProtein Electrophoresis measures the amount of M protein in serum and urine. An abnormal amount of M protein is an indicator of the extent of the disease.\nBone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy is used to estimate the number of myeloma cells, their activity in bone marrow and the degree of damage they have caused to normal bone marrow structure. The bone marrow sample is also used for cytogenetic testing and gene expression profiling.\nCytogenetic Testing identifies chromosomal abnormalities in myeloma cells from a patient\u2019s bone marrow sample. Chromosomal abnormality information helps guide treatment choices.\nGene Expression Profiling, utilizing the bone marrow sample, indicates molecular classification of myeloma, which helps define the nuances of a patient\u2019s myeloma and drive treatment decisions.\nMutation Detection, via molecular genetics tests done on a tissue sample from the patient\u2019s bone marrow, helps identify the patient\u2019s specific myeloma subtype. This information is used to develop precision treatment designed for each individual patient.\nAxial Skeletal Survey, including X-rays of the shoulders, backbone, pelvis and skull, is used to identify the extent of bone disease caused by the myeloma and to evaluate any significant bone damage.\nBone Densitometry indicates status of bone strength and the amount of bone loss, even when no overt symptoms exist. Bone densitometry results provide baseline information that is helpful for future treatment decisions.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a scan of bone and bone marrow, conducted with computerized measurements of radio waves, that enables a close-up view of the bone marrow. It is more effective than standard X-rays for highlighting the presence of myeloma. MRI can identify the exact location and approximate volume of myeloma cells, and it can indicate whether the myeloma has spread.\nDiffusion Weighted Whole Body Imaging (DWIB) MRI is a functional MRI that detects water diffusion through cells. It is used to assess and follow the resolution of bone lesions. The Myeloma Center is unique in utilizing DWIB MRI to guide treatment decisions.\nPositron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (CT/PET) scanning is used to show the presence of active cancer and other abnormalities. The technique combines PET and CT; the images from both devices can be superimposed on each other. This enables alignment of functional imaging, which depicts metabolic activity that can detect cancer cells, with anatomic imaging.\nHow do we treat myeloma?\nTreatment is aimed at controlling the disease, relieving symptoms and complications, extending and improving the quality of life, and, ultimately, cure.\nEach patient\u2019s treatment plan is based on a number of factors, including age, overall health, clinical laboratory and imaging results and prior treatment. At the Myeloma Center, we also utilize specialized genetic diagnostic testing to help determine the best treatment regimen for each patient. This individualized approach holds the greatest promise of cure.\nTreatment may or may not include stem cell transplantation, combinations of chemotherapy, bone-strengthening drugs and immunotherapy. The Myeloma Center\u2019s team of specialists is constantly developing new, innovative treatments with maximum effectiveness and minimal side effects that target malignant cells but spare healthy cells. Our goal is to harness the power of biological understanding for the best possible outcome.\nBy personalizing treatment based on each patient\u2019s genetics and other health and risk factors, we are accelerating targeted treatment strategies tailored for each individual.\nThe Myeloma Center at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences is one of the largest, most comprehensive centers in the world for research and clinical care related to multiple myeloma and related diseases. With a multi-disciplinary team that includes myeloma physicians, pathologists, radiologists and other specialists, the Myeloma Center ensures that all aspects of a patient\u2019s disease and care needs are fully addressed in a complete, comprehensive fashion.\nThe Myeloma Center is committed to accelerating curative therapies for multiple myeloma and related diseases through an integrated program of innovative research and outstanding patient care.", "providers": [{"name": "James J.

If you have narcolepsy, you can experience disturbed nocturnal sleep and an abnormal daytime sleep pattern.\nSometimes narcolepsy is confused with\u00a0insomnia. When falling asleep, narcoleptics generally experience the\u00a0REM stage\u00a0of sleep within five minutes, whereas most people do not experience REM sleep until an hour or so later.\nSymptoms of Narcolepsy\nNarcolepsy occurs in approximately one out of every 2,000 people. Symptoms of narcolepsy include:\n\nExcessive daytime sleepiness\nCataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone that leads to feelings of weakness and loss of muscle control)\nHallucinations\nSleep paralysis\n\nNarcolepsy usually begins between the ages of 15 and 25, but it can become apparent at any age. In many cases, narcolepsy is undiagnosed and, as a result, untreated. A physical exam and extensive medical history are necessary to properly diagnose narcolepsy. Diagnosis can be difficult if the sleep attacks are isolated or if cataplexy is mild or absent.\u00a0Sleep studies\u00a0or tests are usually required before a diagnosis.\nAlthough narcolepsy cannot be cured, treatment can help patients significantly. Treatment is individualized for your particular case. Oral medications are the main treatment method of narcolepsy, but lifestyle changes can also be an improvement for patients.", "providers": [{"name": "Khaled R.

Some are made directly from opium, such as\u00a0morphine, and codeine, while others are man-made but similar chemically to opium, including the painkillers oxycodone, hydrocodone, and fentanyl, better known by such brand names as Oxycontin, Vicodin, Percocet and Actiq. Heroin is also an opioid.\nFor many, the decision to begin taking drugs is voluntary: it may have started with medicine that your doctor prescribed for serious pain, or with recreational drug use with prescription pain medications or heroin. Regardless of how you became dependent, once dependence has developed it is considered a disease that requires treatment. And, once a person becomes addicted or dependent on a drug, he or she may find that willpower is no match for the chemical, behavioral, and psychological nature of opioid dependence.\nSigns of Opioid Dependence\nA person who shows three or more of the following behaviors over a 12-month period is most likely opioid-dependent:\n\nNeeding to take more of the drug to get the same effect\u2014or getting a lesser effect from the same amount of drug;\nExperiencing withdrawal symptoms when not using opioids, or taking other drugs to help relieve withdrawal symptoms;\nTaking larger amounts of opioids than planned, and for longer periods of time;\nPersistently wanting to quit, or trying unsuccessfully to quit;\nSpending a lot of time and effort to obtain, use, and recover from taking opioids;\nWorking less, missing work, or, if unemployed, not seriously looking for a job;\nSpending less time seeing friends who don\u2019t use opioids; skipping recreational activities;\nContinuing to use opioids despite negative consequences.", "providers": [{"name": "Nihit Kumar, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12387/Kumar_Nihit-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Pediatric Psychiatrist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/nihit-kumar/"}, {"name": "Shona L.

The tumor will frequently extend into what appears to be normal skin, making the extent of the surgical resection difficult to determine.\nApproximately 15% of patients with vulvar Paget\u2019s disease will also have invasive Paget\u2019s disease or an underlying invasive adenocarcinoma of the vulva.

Together they help the body fight infections and other diseases.\nWhen germs such as bacteria or viruses invade your body, they attack and multiply. This is called an infection. The infection causes the disease that makes you sick. Your immune system protects you from the disease by fighting off the germs.\nWhat are the parts of the immune system?\nThe immune system has many different parts, including\n\nYour skin, which can help prevent germs from getting into the body\nMucous membranes, which are the moist, inner linings of some organs and body cavities. They make mucus and other substances which can trap and fight germs.\nWhite blood cells, which fight germs\nOrgans and tissues of the lymph system, such as the thymus, spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes, lymph vessels, and bone marrow.  They produce, store, and carry white blood cells.\n\nHow does the immune system work?\nYour immune system defends your body against substances it sees as harmful or foreign. These substances are called antigens. They may be germs such as bacteria and viruses. They might be chemicals or toxins. They could also be cells that are damaged from things like cancer or sunburn.\nWhen your immune system recognizes an antigen, it attacks it. This is called an immune response. Part of this response is to make antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that work to attack, weaken, and destroy antigens. Your body also makes other cells to fight the antigen.\nAfterwards, your immune system remembers the antigen. If it sees the antigen again, it can recognize it. It will quickly send out the right antibodies, so in most cases, you don't get sick. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.\nWhat are the types of immunity?\nThere are three different types of immunity:\n\nInnate immunity is the protection that you are born with. It is your body's first line of defense. It includes barriers such as the skin and mucous membranes. They keep harmful substances from entering the body. It also includes some cells and chemicals which can attack foreign substances.\nActive immunity, also called adaptive immunity, develops when you are infected with or vaccinated against a foreign substance. Active immunity is usually long-lasting. For many diseases, it can last your entire life.\nPassive immunity happens when you receive antibodies to a disease instead of making them through your own immune system. For example, newborn babies have antibodies from their mothers. People can also get passive immunity through blood products that contain antibodies. This kind of immunity gives you protection right away. But it only lasts a few weeks or months.\n\nWhat can go wrong with the immune system?\nSometimes a person may have an immune response even though there is no real threat. This can lead to problems such as allergies, asthma, and autoimmune diseases. If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake.\nOther immune system problems happen when your immune system does not work correctly. These problems include immunodeficiency diseases. If you have an immunodeficiency disease, you get sick more often. Your infections may last longer and can be more serious and harder to treat. They are often genetic disorders.\nThere are other diseases that can affect your immune system. For example, HIV is a virus that harms your immune system by destroying your white blood cells. If HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). People with AIDS have badly damaged immune systems. They get an increasing number of severe illnesses.Courtesy of MedlinePlus from the National Library of Medicine.Syndicated Content Details:Source URL: https://medlineplus.gov/immunesystemanddisorders.html?utm_source=mplusconnect&utm_medium=serviceSource Agency: National Library of Medicine", "providers": [{"name": "Veronica M.

While you are sleeping, you are unconscious, but your brain and body functions are still active. They are doing a number of important jobs that help you stay healthy and function at your best. So when you don't get enough quality sleep, it does more than just make you feel tired. It can affect your physical and mental health, thinking, and daily functioning.\nWhat are sleep disorders?\nSleep disorders are conditions that disturb your normal sleep patterns. There are more than 80 different sleep disorders. Some major types include\n\nInsomnia - being unable to fall asleep and stay asleep. This is the most common sleep disorder.\nSleep apnea - a breathing disorder in which you stop breathing for 10 seconds or more during sleep\nRestless leg syndrome (RLS) - a tingling or prickly sensation in your legs, along with a powerful urge to move them\nHypersomnia - being unable to stay awake during the day. This includes narcolepsy, which causes extreme daytime sleepiness.\nCircadian rhythm disorders - problems with the sleep-wake cycle. They make you unable to sleep and wake at the right times.\nParasomnia - acting in unusual ways while falling asleep, sleeping, or waking from sleep, such as walking, talking, or eating\n\nSome people who feel tired during the day have a true sleep disorder. But for others, the real problem is not allowing enough time for sleep. It's important to get enough sleep every night. The amount of sleep you need depends on several factors, including your age, lifestyle, health, and whether you have been getting enough sleep recently. Most adults need about 7-8 hours each night.\nWhat causes sleep disorders?\nThere are different causes for different sleep disorders, including\n\nOther conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease, nerve disorders, and pain\nMental illnesses, including depression and anxiety\nMedicines\nGenetics\n\nSometimes the cause is unknown.\nThere are also some factors that can contribute to sleep problems, including\n\nCaffeine and alcohol\nAn irregular schedule, such as working the night shift\nAging. As people age, they often get less sleep or spend less time in the deep, restful stage of sleep. They are also more easily awakened.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of sleep disorders?\nThe symptoms of sleep disorders depend on the specific disorder. Some signs that you may have a sleep disorder include that\n\nYou regularly take more than 30 minutes each night to fall asleep\nYou regularly wake up several times each night and then have trouble falling back to sleep, or you wake up too early in the morning\nYou often feel sleepy during the day, take frequent naps, or fall asleep at the wrong times during the day\nYour bed partner says that when you sleep, you snore loudly, snort, gasp, make choking sounds, or stop breathing for short periods\nYou have creeping, tingling, or crawling feelings in your legs or arms that are relieved by moving or massaging them, especially in the evening and when trying to fall asleep\nYour bed partner notices that your legs or arms jerk often during sleep\nYou have vivid, dreamlike experiences while falling asleep or dozing\nYou have episodes of sudden muscle weakness when you are angry or fearful, or when you laugh\nYou feel as though you cannot move when you first wake up\n\nHow are sleep disorders diagnosed?\nTo make a diagnosis, your health care provider will use your medical history, your sleep history, and a physical exam. You may also have a sleep study (polysomnogram). The most common types of sleep studies monitor and record data about your body during a full night of sleep. The data includes\n\nBrain wave changes\nEye movements\nBreathing rate\nBlood pressure\nHeart rate and electrical activity of the heart and other muscles\n\nOther types of sleep studies may check how quickly you fall asleep during daytime naps or whether you are able to stay awake and alert during the day.\nWhat are the treatments for sleep disorders?\nTreatments for sleep disorders depend on which disorder you have. They may include\n\nGood sleep habits and other lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and exercise\nCognitive behavioral therapy or relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety about getting enough sleep\nCPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine for sleep apnea\nBright light therapy (in the morning)\nMedicines, including sleeping pills. Usually, providers recommend that you use sleeping pills for a short period of time.\nNatural products, such as melatonin. These products may help some people but are generally for short-term use. Make sure to check with your health care provider before you take any of them.\nCourtesy of MedlinePlus from the National Library of Medicine.Syndicated Content Details:Source URL: https://medlineplus.gov/sleepdisorders.html?utm_source=mplusconnect&utm_medium=serviceSource Agency: National Library of Medicine", "providers": [], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": []}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/parasomnias/": {"name": "Condition: Parasomnias", "description": "", "providers": [{"name": "Gregory S.

After the baby is delivered, the placenta does not separate from the uterus as it should. This can cause life-threatening bleeding if it isn\u2019t properly treated. Placenta accreta spectrum occurs in less than 1% of all pregnancies.\nThe UAMS Approach to Treating Placenta Accreta Spectrum\nAs of February 2020, UAMS is a recognized Placenta Accreta Center of Excellence according to\u00a0the Maternal Safety Foundation. We are the only program in Arkansas to offer specialized treatment and management of placenta accreta spectrum. The UAMS Placenta Accreta Spectrum Care Team is a diverse team of doctors led by experienced maternal-fetal medicine specialists who work with obstetrical anesthesiologists, acute care surgeons, and neonatologists to provide the best care for women with disorders of the placenta accreta spectrum. We may also involve other sub-specialists such as urologists, gynecologic oncologists, or vascular surgeons.\nOur approach includes:\n\nConsultation with one of the maternal-fetal medicine doctors who specializes in the management and treatment of placenta accreta spectrum.\nUltrasound evaluation and MRI if indicated.\nConsultation with the obstetric anesthesiology team\nConsultation with the neonatology team. Because most of these babies are born before their due date, they often have to spend time in the NICU.\nPlan for a carefully timed, controlled cesarean delivery.\nSteroid administration before delivery to help with the baby\u2019s lung development.\nResources available at the time of surgery:\n\nLargest blood bank in the state\nMedical resources available at the time of surgery like REBOA and Cell Saver\nAnesthesiology staff specially trained in obstetrics\nSurgical specialists on-call 24/7\n\n\n\nMore About Placenta Accreta Spectrum\nPlacenta accreta spectrum is defined by how deeply the placenta is attached to the uterus. It includes:\n\nPlacenta accreta \u2013 Placenta grows into the uterine lining.\nPlacenta increta \u2013 Placenta grows into the muscular wall of the uterus.\nPlacenta percreta \u2013 Placenta grows through the muscular wall of the uterus and can sometimes become attached to nearby structures, such as the bowel, bladder or blood vessels.\n\nWho is at risk for placenta accreta?\n\nPatients with placenta previa, which is where a portion of the placenta covers the cervix\nThose with a history of c-section (risk increases with the number of prior c-sections)\nThose with a history of a D&C, ablation or other uterine surgeries\nAge 35 or older\nPatients with a history of smoking\nPatients who have had infertility treatment\nPatients with a history of uterine infections\n\nDiagnosis of Placenta Accreta\nPlacenta accreta is most commonly diagnosed through an ultrasound. MRI is sometimes used, mostly to help with delivery planning. Patients with a history of previous c-section deliveries, especially those with a placenta previa, should be carefully screened.\nAbout a Delivery Complicated by Placenta Accreta Spectrum\n\nDelivery is typically planned for 4-6 weeks before the due date\nA hysterectomy is performed\nThe hospital stay is usually longer (4-5 days as opposed to 2)\nMore blood loss is usually encountered and often requires transfusion of blood products\nA vertical or \u201cup and down\u201d incision is used that typically extends above the belly button rather than a \u201cbikini cut\u201d\nICU stay for the mother and NICU stay for the baby are often required after delivery\nThe risk of damage to bowel, bladder and surrounding vessels is higher\n\nIf the placenta does not separate from the uterus at the time of delivery, a hysterectomy is often required in order to prevent severe maternal blood loss. Because these surgeries are so high-risk, it is important to seek care at a hospital with a designated team that performs these procedures often.", "providers": [{"name": "Dawn S.

Normal plasma cells in the bone marrow produce antibodies that fight infection.\nIn myeloma most of the abnormal plasma cells remain in the bone marrow and are not found in the peripheral blood. In PCL, the abnormal plasma cells are in the peripheral blood. Therefore, PCL is considered to be an advanced form of myeloma. PCL can either originate as the primary manifestation of the disease (primary PCL with no history of myeloma) or as a transformation of myeloma (secondary PCL with progression of previously diagnosed myeloma).\n\nKey Statistics and Risk Factors\nPrimary PCL is rare, with an estimated 1 per million of the general population diagnosed each year. Secondary PCL occurs in one to four out of 100 cases of myeloma and is becoming more common as myeloma patients are living longer.\nAs with myeloma, PCL is more common in African Americans than in Caucasians and is slightly more common in men than in women. As new insights and knowledge about the biology of myeloma and PCL are gained, it may be possible to determine which myeloma patients are at increased risk for developing PCL.\nThe causes of PCL are similar to those of myeloma. A series of genetic alterations during the development of a plasma cell may to lead to the cell\u2019s uncontrolled growth. However, what triggers these alterations is not fully known. Risk factors, such as age and exposure to industrial and environmental elements, are thought to play important roles.\nSigns and Symptoms\nWhile PCL patients often have symptoms and complications similar to those of myeloma patients, they tend to be more severe. Symptoms and complications include:\n\nBone pain\nFatigue\nRecurring infections\nBleeding\nHigh levels of calcium (hypercalcemia)\nKidney damage\nEnlarged liver or spleen resulting from large numbers of abnormal plasma cells deposited in these organs.\n\nDiagnosing PCL\nPCL is diagnosed by the number of abnormal plasma cells circulating in the blood. In PCL patients, abnormal plasma cells make up more than 20% of the total number of white blood cells present in the peripheral blood. PCL is diagnosed in the same way as myeloma.\nTreatment\nCurrent treatments for primary PCL are the same as those for myeloma. Most secondary PCL patients have already had several anti-myeloma treatments, and for some patients their disease may have become resistant, or refractory, to the treatments. For these patients, more intensive treatments using combinations of chemotherapy drugs, steroids and new agents may be considered.\nTreatments may include:\n\nChemotherapy agents, such as cisplatin, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide\nProteosome inhibitors, such as Velcade\u00ae (bortezomib)\nImmunomodulatory agents, such as Revlimid\u00ae (lenalidomide) and thalidomide\nHigh-dose therapy and stem cell transplantation for younger and/or healthier patients\nNewer agents, such as Kyprolis\u00ae (carfilzomib) and Imnovid\u00ae (pomalidomide), for those whose disease is refractory to Velcade and Revlimid\nOther novel agents\n\nPrognosis\nBecause of the aggressive nature of the PCL, it is usually associated with a poor prognosis and a survival expectancy that is shorter than that of patients with typical myeloma.\nFuture\nScientists at the Myeloma Center are investigating the characteristics of and risk factors for PCL. Understanding the biological and genetic features that enable development of primary PCL and progression from myeloma to secondary PCL will lead to improved therapies for better patient outcomes.\nPatients are encouraged to consult with their physicians about the most current therapies available.", "providers": [{"name": "Carolina Schinke, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12155/Schinke_Carolina-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/carolina-d-schinke/"}, {"name": "Sharmilan Thanendrarajan, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12242/Thanendrarajan_Sharmilan-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/sharmilan-thanendrarajan/"}, {"name": "Frits van Rhee, M.D., Ph.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/11206/van-Rhee_Frits-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/frits-van-rhee/"}, {"name": "Maurizio Zangari, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12152/Zangari_Maurizio-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/maurizio-zangari/"}], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": [{"name": "Myeloma Center", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cancer-institute-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/myeloma-center/"}]}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/plasmacytoma/": {"name": "Condition: Plasmacytoma", "description": "A type of cancer that begins in plasma cells (white blood cells that produce antibodies).

It affects more men than women, and typically occurs in one\u2019s 50\u2019s. The exact incidence is unknown.\nCauses\nThe cause of POEMS syndrome is not known. However, chronic overproduction of proinflammatory and other cytokines (proteins made by the immune system that act as chemical messengers) seems to be a main feature of the syndrome. Individuals with POEMS syndrome have an increased number of plasma cells.\nSymptoms\nPolyneuropathy\u00a0is characterized by chronic, progressive disease affecting the peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system consists of the motor and sensory nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) to the rest of the body. Individuals with POEMS syndrome experience numbness, tingling, feelings of coldness, and weakness, starting in the toes and feet and progressively working its way upwards. Over time, the hands can be affected.\nOrganomegaly\u00a0refers to abnormal enlargement of the spleen, liver and lymph nodes. Swelling, especially of the lymph nodes, may be present. Biopsy of enlarged lymph nodes may reveal Castleman Disease (a rare disease of lymph nodes and related tissues that results from the overgrowth of the cells in the body\u2019s lymphatic system).\nEndocrinopathy\u00a0refers to abnormalities in the endocrine system (the network of glands that secrete hormones into the circulatory system). Abnormal hormone levels can lead to hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), metabolism problems, improper functioning of the ovaries in females or testes in males, and diabetes.\nMonoclonal protein (M-protein), caused by a monoclonal plasma cell disorder, can be detected in the blood serum and/or urine. Monoclonal plasma cell disorders are characterized by uncontrolled growth of abnormal plasma cells. The overproduction of plasma cells in individuals with POEMS syndrome can result in the formation of tumors known as plasmacytomas; these tumors appear like sclerotic lesions (thickening of the bone) on x-ray. Overproduction of plasma cells can also result in the formation of osteosclerotic lesions in bone.\nSkin abnormalities\u00a0in POEMS syndrome can include abnormal darkening of the skin, hardening and thickening of the skin (sclerosis), increased facial or leg hair, and excessive sweating.\nAdditional symptoms may include fluid buildup in the lungs, chronic renal failure, fluid accumulation in the skin of the arms and legs, and cardiovascular disease.\nDiagnosis\nA diagnosis of POEMS syndrome begins with a complete medical history and physical exam.\nLaboratory tests of blood and urine are conducted to check protein and hormone levels. Often vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels are elevated.\nAdditional diagnostic testing may include:\n\nSkeletal imaging tests, such as CT (computerized tomography) and PET (positron emission tomography) scans, to check for osteosclerotic lesions and enlargement of lymph nodes, liver and spleen\nBiopsy of an osteosclerotic lesion and/or bone marrow biopsy to check for abnormal plasma cells\nLymph node biopsy to diagnose co-existent Castleman Disease\nPulmonary function testing\nEchocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart)\nEndocrine evaluation\nNerve conduction studies to evaluate the neuropathy\n\nTreatment\nTreatment is aimed at the underlying plasma cell disorder and relieving symptoms. Every patient\u2019s disease is different. Myeloma Center physicians are dedicated to defining the nuances of each individual\u2019s disease and customizing treatment regimens that have the most promise for effective results.\nAutologous Stem Cell Transplantation (high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue) is the treatment of choice for transplant eligible patients and often results in dramatic improvement.\nTreatments that are similar to those for myeloma are utilized for non-transplant eligible patients and include:\n\nSteroids, such as dexamethasone, to trigger destruction of abnormal plasma cells\nThalidomide or Revlimid\u00ae (lenalidomide), which are immunomodulatory drugs that act on cells involved in the body\u2019s immune system\nVelcade\u00ae (bortezomib) or Kyprolis\u00ae (carfilzomib), a proteasome inhibitor that causes abnormal cells to die (Proteosomes are protein complexes in cells that degrade unneeded or damaged proteins.)\nRadiation therapy to destroy localized bone lesions\nMonoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, for patients with significant organomegaly\n\nAntibodies which target interleukin 6, e.g., tocilizumab and siltuximab, are often not effective in the treatment of POEMS syndrome. Plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment do not result in a lasting improvement of the neuropathy.\nPatients with POEMS syndrome often need treatment to alleviate the symptoms of neuropathy, extravascular volume overload, and endocrine abnormalities.\n\nNeuropathy \u2013 Physical therapy to strengthen legs and appropriate use of ankle/foot orthotics and walking aids can improve lifestyle.\nExtravascular volume overload \u2013 Diuretics may be used to decrease the amount of excess fluid and swelling\nEndocrine abnormalities \u2013 Hormone replacement may be appropriate for the treatment of hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and other hormone-related symptoms.\n\nThe effectiveness of treatment is monitored on a regular basis.\nPrognosis\nPOEMS syndrome can be effectively treated and significant improvement in overall functioning and quality of life can be expected. Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue), the treatment of choice for transplant eligible patients, often results in dramatic improvement.\nA multi-disciplinary approach to the treatment of POEMS syndrome is essential. The physician team should include myeloma specialists, radiologists, neurologists, nephrologists, cardiologists and other specialists as needed.", "providers": [{"name": "Carolina Schinke, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12155/Schinke_Carolina-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/carolina-d-schinke/"}, {"name": "Sharmilan Thanendrarajan, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12242/Thanendrarajan_Sharmilan-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/sharmilan-thanendrarajan/"}, {"name": "Frits van Rhee, M.D., Ph.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/11206/van-Rhee_Frits-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/frits-van-rhee/"}, {"name": "Maurizio Zangari, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12152/Zangari_Maurizio-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/maurizio-zangari/"}], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": [{"name": "Myeloma Center", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cancer-institute-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/myeloma-center/"}]}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/poisoning/": {"name": "Condition: Poisoning", "description": "", "providers": [{"name": "Henry C.

The most frequent symptoms include:\n\nWeight gain/ trouble losing weight\nIrregular periods\nFertility problems\nAcne\nExtra hair on the face and body\nThinning hair on the scalp\nDepression\n\nTo diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome, your doctor will consider all your signs and symptoms. No specific test diagnoses the condition. Your doctor will probably do a pelvic examination and ultrasound to see the appearance of your ovaries and the thickness of the lining of your uterus.\nInfertility related to PCOS is most often successfully treated with a simple fertility pill or other medications.\nYour doctor will most likely prescribe medication as treatment. The medication that your doctor recommends will vary with your circumstances; it could be medication to regulate your menstrual cycle, help you ovulate or reduce excessive hair growth.

It is common for mothers to experience a feeling of sadness soon after giving birth. However, postpartum depression is a more severe, life-affecting sadness that may require attention from a health care professional.\nPostpartum depression can be experienced in two forms: early-onset and late-onset. Early-onset is mild, more common, may last a couple of weeks and does not require medication. Late-onset usually occurs several weeks to six months after delivery and is not as common as early-onset.\nCauses and Symptoms\nPostpartum depression is often characterized by the following symptoms, although each person may experience symptoms differently:\n\nSadness\nAnxiety\nFatigue\u00a0or exhaustion\nPoor concentration\nConfusion\nA fear of harming the newborn or yourself\nMood swings\nDiminished sex drive\nFeelings of guilt\nUncontrolled crying\nLoss of interest or pleasure in life\nOver-concern for the newborn and/or a lack of interest for the newborn\nAppetite changes\nSleep disturbances\nFeelings of resentment\nMemory loss\nFeelings of isolation\nFeelings of hopelessness\n\nWomen who are at highest risk for postpartum depression include:\n\nThose with a history of depression,\u00a0anxiety disorders\u00a0or\u00a0alcohol abuse\nThose with a history of moderate to severe\u00a0premenstrual syndrome (PMS)\nThose who have\u00a0trouble sleeping\nThose who have unrealistic ideas about motherhood\nThose who have an unwanted pregnancy\nThose who experience a stressful life event such as the death of a loved one, a family illness or work difficulties\nThose who lack emotional support from a partner or experience conflict with a partner\nThose who have low self-esteem\nThose who have a newborn with physical or behavioral problems\n\nThe exact cause of postpartum depression is unknown. However, it is believed that the hormone level changes that occur during and after pregnancy may produce chemical changes in the brain to make women more susceptible to depression.\nAddressing Postpartum Depression\nPostpartum depression is usually treated, like other types of depression, with counseling and medication. Counseling may involve talking with a therapist about how depression makes you think, act and feel. Medication is usually given to those with severe cases of postpartum depression. Some antidepressant medications can harm your baby if you are breastfeeding. Talk to your doctor about which medicine is safe to take.\nThere are also steps you can take to help manage and overcome postpartum depression symptoms. These include:\n\nFind a companion you can share your feelings with or find a local support group.\nGet in touch with someone who can help take on some of your daily duties, such as childcare, household chores and errands.\nSet aside at least 30 minutes a day to do something for yourself.\nKeep a diary where you write down your emotions.", "providers": [{"name": "Nancy Andrews Collins, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/54674/Collins_Nancy-Andrews-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Obstetrician/Gynecologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/nancy-andrews-collins/"}, {"name": "William W.  \"Sam\" Greenfield, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/11712/Greenfield_William-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Obstetrician/Gynecologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/william-w-greenfield/"}, {"name": "Melissa S.

If a pregnant woman has an STD, it can cause serious health problems for the baby.\nAntibiotics can treat STDs caused by bacteria or parasites. There is no cure for STDs caused by a virus, but medicines can often help with the symptoms and keep the disease under control.\nCorrect usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STDs.

Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder that occurs when your breathing is interrupted during sleep. If sleep apnea\u00a0is untreated, it could cause you to stop breathing repeatedly during sleep, sometimes hundreds of times.\nSymptoms\nThere are two types of sleep apnea: obstructive and central. Obstructive sleep apnea is the more common form that is caused by a blockage of the airway. Central sleep apnea is when the brain fails to signal the muscles to breathe due to instability in the respiratory control center.\nSleep apnea is more common in males and people who are overweight. There is also an increased risk if you have gastroesophageal reflux or have a family history of sleep apnea.\nBecause it only occurs during sleep, most people who have sleep apnea aren\u2019t aware of the issue. A family member or bed partner may first notice the signs of sleep apnea. The condition is diagnosed with an overnight sleep test or\u00a0sleep study.\nThe most common symptoms of sleep apnea include:\n\nWaking up with a very sore and/or dry throat\nLoud\u00a0snoring\nOccasionally waking up with a choking or gasping sensation\nDaytime fatigue\nRestless sleep\n\nDiagnosis and Treatment\nTreatment for sleep apnea varies depending on the individual and the severity of the case. For mild cases, behavioral therapy may help, such as sleeping on your side, avoiding alcohol, sleeping pills or other sedatives. One of the most common ways to treat the condition is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. This machine generates the required air pressure the keep your airways open during sleep. Sometimes surgery is another option for treatment.", "providers": [{"name": "Caris Talburt Fitzgerald, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/917067/Fitzgerald_Caris-Talburt-1-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Sleep Medicine Physician", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/caris-talburt-fitzgerald/"}, {"name": "Khaled R.

SMM is characterized by the presence in the blood of an abnormal protein produced by plasma cells and the presence of free light chains in the blood or urine.\nThe abnormal protein is referred to as an M\u2013protein or paraprotein. It is monoclonal, which means that it is produced by one family of cells that are all identical copies of each other.\nPlasma cells, found in the bone marrow and in blood, normally produce antibodies that fight infection.\n\nKey Statistics and Risk Factors\nSMM accounts for approximately 15% of all cases of newly diagnosed myeloma. Like myeloma, SMM is more common in men than in women and is nearly twice as common in African-Americans as in Caucasians.\nThere is no known cause for SMM. The amounts of abnormal plasma cells and paraprotein in the bone marrow have been identified as risk factors for progression of SMM to active myeloma.\nSigns and Symptoms\nSMM is sometimes called asymptomatic myeloma, because patients do not usually experience any symptoms. Occasionally, patients have numbness or tingling in their hands and feet or problems with their balance. This may be due to damage to nerves caused by the paraprotein in the blood.\nUnlike patients with myeloma, patients with SMM do not have high levels of calcium, poor kidney function or low blood cell counts, and x-rays of the bones and PET scans are normal.\nPatients with SMM should watch for any symptoms, such as bone pain and fatigue, as they might indicate progression to myeloma.\nDiagnosing Smoldering Myeloma\nSMM is usually detected incidentally during a routine check-up when there are increased levels of paraprotein and/or free light chains in the blood and/or urine. The diagnosis is then confirmed by having further blood tests and a bone marrow biopsy.\nSMM is clinically defined by a paraprotein level greater than 30 grams per deciliter, more than 10% plasma cells in the bone marrow and no myeloma-related organ or tissue impairment. Patients who have higher concentrations of paraprotein and/or free light chains in the blood and/or the urine will usually have further testing, such as imaging studies of the skeleton.\nThe Myeloma Center has classified two types of SMM. Low Risk SMM is generally benign, but it needs to be closely monitored as it can progress to myeloma. High-Risk SMM usually progresses to myeloma in approximately 12 to 18 months after diagnosis.\nThe risk type of SMM is determined by molecular diagnostic testing that is performed on the patient\u2019s bone marrow samples.\nTreatment\nMany patients with Low Risk SMM do not need treatment, but need to be followed closely by their physician. High-Risk SMM patients can benefit from treatment to slow the progression to active myeloma. Physicians and scientists at the Myeloma Center are investigating treatments employing steroids and drugs that work with the immune system (known as immunomodulatory and monoclonal antibodies) to assess their potential effectiveness in the treatment of High-Risk SMM, and ultimately to develop curative therapies.\nPatients with SMM should have blood work every two to three months after initial diagnosis. It is important for patients to contact their doctor between check-ups if they develop any new symptoms.\nPrognosis\nWhile not all SMM patients develop active MM, many do. Data shows that approximately 10% of SMM patients progress to active myeloma every year in the first five years, 3% per year in years 6-10, and 1% per year thereafter. Newly developed symptoms such as pain, fatigue, or weight loss can be signs that the disease has progressed.\nPrognosis\nAt the Myeloma Center, our understanding of the molecular and genetic processes underlying SMM and myeloma continues to expand. This knowledge guides our ability to tailor treatment strategies that can delay progression to active myeloma or even cure patients at the precancerous stage.", "providers": [{"name": "Carolina Schinke, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12155/Schinke_Carolina-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/carolina-d-schinke/"}, {"name": "Sharmilan Thanendrarajan, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12242/Thanendrarajan_Sharmilan-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/sharmilan-thanendrarajan/"}, {"name": "Frits van Rhee, M.D., Ph.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/11206/van-Rhee_Frits-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/frits-van-rhee/"}, {"name": "Maurizio Zangari, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12152/Zangari_Maurizio-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/maurizio-zangari/"}], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": [{"name": "Myeloma Center", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cancer-institute-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/myeloma-center/"}]}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/snake-bite/": {"name": "Condition: Snake Bite", "description": "", "providers": [{"name": "Henry C.

Each section has normal contours. The spine normally curves inward slightly (lordosis) at the cervical spine, curves outward (kyphosis) in the thoracic spine, and curves inward again (lordosis) in the lumbar spine. If these normal curves are lost or exaggerated, issues with alignment can arise.\nScoliosis\nScoliosis is a curvature of the spine. Scoliosis can be congenital (present at birth), develop during adolescence (adolescent-onset idiopathic scoliosis), or develop related to arthritis in the spine over time as an adult.\n\nOrthotics and braces for scoliosis: Although bracing can be used in the spine for scoliosis in children, it will not correct curvatures of the adult spine. Bracing frequently for pain relief can cause an overall weakening of the spine muscles and can actually lead to more long-term pain.\n\nKyphosis\nWhen the natural outward curve of the spine becomes abnormal, this is called \u201cincreased kyphosis.\u201d It is essentially an abnormal rounding of the spine.\u00a0 This can range from mild and relatively asymptomatic to severe and disabling.\nAbout These Spinal Deformities\nSigns and Symptoms\n\nPain and stiffness into the back and neck\nNumbness or weakness\nShooting pain into the legs\nInability to stand up straight\nDifficulty walking\nBalance issues resulting in falls\nDifficulty lying flat\nChanges in bowel or bladder control\n\nDiagnostic Tests\n\nX-ray\nMRI\nCT with or without contrast dye\nSpine survey or EOS imaging: x-ray that can show your body\u2019s alignment from head to toe\n\nAbout Treatment\nTreatments for adult spinal deformities are greatly different than those for adolescents or children.

Often, the weakness of the vertebra is due to a fracture, trauma or arthritis. This can cause a kink in the spinal nerves that leads to pain, numbness, or weakness in your back and legs.\nAt UAMS, we use several different diagnostic tools to diagnose spondylolisthesis. That includes:\n\nX-ray\nMRI\nCT with or without dye\n\nHow You Can Contribute to a Healthier Spine\nIt is important to maintain a healthy spine by staying physically active, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight. Bone density also impacts your spine health. Ask your healthcare provider if you need a bone density exam. Maintaining a good bone density is important to reduce your risk of an osteoporotic fracture. There are medications that your doctor may prescribe that can increase your bone density and reduce your risk of fractures.\nAnother way to contribute to a healthy spine is to quit using nicotine products. Nicotine decreases the blood supply to your spinal discs and the bones in the spine. This has been shown to accelerate the degenerative changes in the spine. Nicotine users have been shown to have more spine pain. Nicotine cessation is very important for your spine health.spondylolisthesis", "providers": [{"name": "David B.

There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic stroke is the less common type. It happens when a blood vessel breaks and bleeds into the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. Causes include a bleeding aneurysm, an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), or an artery wall that breaks open.\nSymptoms of stroke are\n\nSudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)\nSudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech\nSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes\nSudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination\nSudden severe headache with no known cause\n\nIt is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. With a hemorrhagic stroke, the first steps are to find the cause of bleeding in the brain and then control it.  Surgery may be needed.  Post-stroke rehabilitation can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage.\n  National Institute of Neurological Disorders and StrokeCourtesy of MedlinePlus from the National Library of Medicine.Syndicated Content Details:Source URL: https://medlineplus.gov/hemorrhagicstroke.html?utm_source=mplusconnect&utm_medium=serviceSource Agency: National Library of Medicine", "providers": [{"name": "Adewumi D.

It often occurs with other problems, such as\n\n Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD)\n Obsessive-compulsive disorder  (OCD)\n Anxiety\n Depression\n\nThe cause of Tourette syndrome is unknown.

Many people eventually outgrow them. \nNo treatment is needed unless the tics interfere with everyday life. Excitement or worry can make tics worse. Calm, focused activities may make them better.

Tics usually appear in childhood, and their severity varies over time. In most cases, tics become milder and less frequent in late adolescence and adulthood.Tourette syndrome involves both motor tics, which are uncontrolled body movements, and vocal or phonic tics, which are outbursts of sound. Some motor tics are simple and involve only one muscle group. Simple motor tics, such as rapid eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, or nose twitching, are usually the first signs of Tourette syndrome. Motor tics also can be complex (involving multiple muscle groups), such as jumping, kicking, hopping, or spinning.Vocal tics, which generally appear later than motor tics, also can be simple or complex. Simple vocal tics include grunting, sniffing, and throat-clearing.  More complex vocalizations include repeating the words of others (echolalia) or repeating one's own words (palilalia). The involuntary use of inappropriate or obscene language (coprolalia) is possible, but uncommon, among people with Tourette syndrome.In addition to frequent tics, people with Tourette syndrome are at risk for associated problems including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, depression, and problems with sleep.Courtesy of MedlinePlus from the National Library of Medicine.Syndicated Content Details:Source URL: https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/tourette-syndrome?utm_source=mplusconnect&utm_medium=serviceSource Agency: National Library of Medicine", "providers": [{"name": "J.

With chronic, you may be able to urinate by have trouble emptying your bladder completely or may feel the urgent need to urinate but have little success when you get to the toilet. With acute, you can\u2019t go to the bathroom at all, even though you have a full bladder. This type is a medical emergency and you should seek a doctor\u2019s care immediately.\nDiagnosis and Treatment\nThe condition is most common with men in their 50s and 60s; however, it can also occur in women. A woman may experience urinary retention if her bladder sags or moves out of normal position. For diagnosis, your doctor will perform a number of tests including a urine sample and a bladder scan.\nTreatment is different depending on the type you have. With acute, urinary catheterization relieves the retention.

A UTI can affect any area of the urinary system, which consists of the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra.\nCauses and Symptoms of UTIs\nMost UTIs are caused by bacteria from the bowel or digestive system, such as\u00a0E. coli. An infection occurs when bacteria cling to the opening of the urethra that carries urine from the bladder to outside of the body begin to multiply.\nSymptoms of a UTI vary by age and gender. The following are the most common symptoms of an infection:\n\nFrequent urination\nFatigue, tiredness or shakiness\nBurning or pain when urinating\nUncomfortable pressure in lower abdomen\nUrine that is cloudy, reddish or has a foul smell\nPain in the back or side\nNausea and/or vomiting\nFever\nMuscle aches\n\nWomen\u00a0are more prone to getting\u00a0urinary tract infections\u00a0than men because a woman\u2019s urethra is shorter, allowing bacteria quicker access to the bladder, and is located close to the sources of bacteria in the body.\nOthers who are at risk for developing an infection include the following:\n\nThose with spinal cord injuries and other nerve damage around the bladder\nThose with an abnormality of the urinary tract, such as a\u00a0kidney stone\u00a0or enlarged\u00a0prostate\nThose with\u00a0diabetes\u00a0or problems with the immune system\nThose with catheters or tubes placed in the urethra or bladder\n\nAlthough most UTIs are not serious, they can lead to more serious problems such as kidney infections. Chronic kidney infections can cause permanent damage to the kidney.\nDiagnosis, Treatment and Prevention\nDoctors diagnose UTIs by taking a urine sample. If you have recurrent UTIs, your doctor may conduct additional testing that may include a\u00a0kidney and bladder ultrasound,\u00a0CT scan,\u00a0MRI\u00a0or\u00a0cystoscopy.\nTreatments for UTIs usually include taking a prescribed medication and making lifestyle changes such as drinking more water, avoiding coffee, alcohol and spicy foods, and not smoking.\nTo prevent a urinary tract infection, consider the following:\n\nDrink plenty of water and drinks with vitamin C such as cranberry juice.\nUrinate when you feel the need.\nTake showers instead of tub baths.\nCleanse the genital area thoroughly and regularly.\nAvoid using feminine hygiene sprays.", "providers": [], "areas_of_expertise": [{"name": "Primary Care", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/primary-care-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/expertise/primary-care/"}], "locations": [{"name": "Student Health Clinic", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Bruce-fountain-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/student-health-clinic/"}]}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/uterine-and-vaginal-anomalies/": {"name": "Condition: Uterine and Vaginal Anomalies", "description": "", "providers": [], "areas_of_expertise": [{"name": "Gynecology", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/iStock-898903840-1-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/expertise/womens-health/gynecology/"}], "locations": []}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/uterine-bleeding/": {"name": "Condition: Uterine Bleeding", "description": "", "providers": [], "areas_of_expertise": [{"name": "Gynecology", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/iStock-898903840-1-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/expertise/womens-health/gynecology/"}], "locations": []}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/uterine-fibroids/": {"name": "Condition: Uterine Fibroids", "description": "Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors in women of childbearing age.

That\u2019s because the primary risk factor for endometrial cancer is obesity.\nSymptoms of Endometrial Cancer\nEndometrial cancer is a disease that often presents early because women have symptoms early. Post-menopausal bleeding, for example, can a symptom of endometrial cancer. Any degree of post-menopausal bleeding is abnormal and should warrant investigation. If a woman has gone through menopause and two years later she has a little bit of spotting, she needs to see her healthcare provider. Even if it doesn\u2019t come back, she needs to see someone because it can be that subtle. Fortunately for the majority of women, it is going to be early-stage at the time of diagnosis.

The typical person who would develop this is a woman who is 65 or older.\nInnovative Radiation Therapy for Vaginal Cancer at UAMS\nThe treatment for vaginal cancer is typically radiation therapy. When you receive radiation, you\u2019ll usually receive what we call \u201cexternal beam,\u201d which is like sitting on an x-ray table. It\u2019s done once a day, five days a week, for four or five weeks.\nAfter that, we may deliver radiation directly to the tumor through internal radiation therapy (also called brachytherapy). With internal radiation therapy, an implant delivers a much higher dose of radiation directly to the vagina. This is often curative.\nThe advantage of a place like UAMS is that we are well known for our internal radiation therapy.

This could include the heart valve(s) becoming narrowed or leaky.\nThe heart has four valves associated with the four chambers of the heart. When each of the four chambers of the heart contracts, the associated valve opens to allow blood to go forward. When a heart chamber relaxes to fill up with blood again, the associated valve closes so blood does not flow backward. In adults, valvular heart disease is more likely to occur in the left heart as the left heart generates much higher pressures than the right.\nIt is possible for either the aortic or mitral valve on the left to become narrowed (stenotic) or leaky (regurgitant). A narrowed valve leads to an increase in pressure, and a leaky valve leads to extra work to make up for the blood that flows backward. These conditions can cause you to:\n\nPass out/faint\nDevelop chest pain\nDevelop heart failure\nHave irregular heart action\nHave a stroke\n\nTreatment for the disease varies depending on individual cases. It may only require you to be closely followed by a doctor or may require surgery to repair or replace a valve. After you see one of our valvular heart specialists, a determination will be made for treatment and whether additional imaging studies are needed.", "providers": [{"name": "Michael J.

The main cells of lymphoid tissue are referred to as lymphocytes.\nThere are two main types of lymphocytes.\nB lymphocytes (B cells)\u00a0respond to an infection by changing into plasma cells. Plasma cells make proteins known as antibodies or immunoglobulins that help the body attack and kill disease-causing germs like bacteria. T lymphocytes (T cells) help direct immune responses and also can directly kill invading germs.\nIn Waldenstrom\u2019s, one of the B cells transforms into a cancer cell, which then multiplies out of control. Waldenstrom\u2019s cells can grow in the liver, spleen and lymph nodes, causing them to swell. They can also grow in the bone marrow, crowding out normal cells.\nWhen this happens, levels of red blood cells (which carry oxygen through the body) and white blood cells (which help the body fight infection) may fall. Levels of platelets, a type of blood cell that is responsible for clotting and stopping bleeding, also may fall.\nA feature of Waldenstrom\u2019s is the overproduction by B cells of a protein called monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM, or macroglobulin) antibody, which circulates in the blood. The buildup of IgM can cause the blood to become too thick. This is called hyperviscosity. It can make it harder for blood to flow through small blood vessels and can cause symptoms of Waldenstrom\u2019s, such as problems with vision and the nervous system.\nThe cancer cells of Waldenstrom\u2019s are similar to those of two other types of cancer: multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells; non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of lymphocytes. Waldenstrom\u2019s cells have features of both plasma cells and lymphocytes; Waldenstrom\u2019s is a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.\nKey Statistics\n\nWaldenstrom\u2019s is rare. About six people per one million are diagnosed each year in the United States; between 1,000 and 1,500 people are diagnosed annually.\nThe chance of developing Waldenstrom\u2019s increases with age. Waldenstrom\u2019s mainly strikes individuals age 65 and older and most often affects white males.\nIt is considered a low-grade, or indolent, lymphoma; it spreads slowly and can be well-controlled when diagnosed early.\n\nCauses\nNo definite cause for Waldenstrom\u2019s has been identified. However, environmental, familial, genetic, and viral factors might play a role. About one in five people with Waldenstrom\u2019s has a close relative with Waldenstrom\u2019s or a related B-cell disease, such as MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance) or some types of lymphoma or leukemia.\nCertain changes in the DNA inside normal lymphocytes can cause them to become lymphoma or multiple myeloma cells. Changes in the DNA of some lymphoma cells can also cause them to produce high levels of IgM, leading to symptoms of Waldenstrom\u2019s. The DNA changes in Waldenstrom\u2019s cells are usually acquired after birth, versus being passed on from a parent. They often occur for no clear reason.\nWaldenstrom\u2019s cells frequently have a mutation in a gene (genes are comprised of DNA) known as MYD88, which normally helps immune system cells signal each other and helps keep them alive. It is possible that the DNA change in this gene might make it stay turned \u201con\u201d all the time, helping the Waldenstrom\u2019s cells survive longer than they should. Myeloma Center scientists are investigating the factors that cause some genes to stay \u201con\u201d and others to stay \u201coff.\u201d\nSymptoms\nThe overgrowth of B cell lymphocytes in Waldenstrom\u2019s inhibits the growth of normal cells, resulting in low numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, which can lead to fatigue, frequent infections and excessive bruising or bleeding. The abnormal lymphocytes also grow in the liver and spleen, which can cause the organs to become enlarged and result in abdominal pain.\nSymptoms of Waldenstrom\u2019s can include:\n\nFatigue\nBleeding of the gums\nNose bleeding\nBlurred or decreased vision\nDizziness, headache, confusion\nEasy bruising of the skin\nNumbness or tingling in the hands or feet\nWeight loss\nFever and night sweats\nSwollen lymph nodes\nHeart palpitations\nSwelling in the feet and legs\nAbdominal pain\n\nIt is possible for a person to be asymptomatic and yet, based on high levels of IgM, be diagnosed with Waldenstrom\u2019s. Sometimes Waldenstrom\u2019s produces few symptoms and develops slowly.\nDiagnosis\nThe presence of IgM protein in the blood is a characteristic feature of Waldenstrom\u2019s. It is often discovered when a person goes to the doctor because of overt symptoms or just not feeling well. Sometimes it is found in people without symptoms who have blood work done for other reasons.\nA diagnosis of Waldenstrom\u2019s is confirmed by performing a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy to determine whether abnormal lymphocytes are present. Additionally, specialized blood tests, such as serum protein electrophoresis, and urine tests are used to detect IgM protein and low blood cell counts.\nMolecular genetic tests might be done to look for specific chromosome or gene changes.\nTreatment\nTreatment is based on an individual\u2019s symptoms and complications. Selection of treatment may be affected by factors such as age, general health and the type of symptoms. Not everyone with Waldenstrom\u2019s needs to be treated right away. Often, people who do not have serious or bothersome symptoms can be watched closely and then treated later, if needed.\nIf treatment is needed, there are several options.\n\nChemotherapy, including chlorambucil (Leukeran), cladribine (Leustatin), cyclophosphamide (Neosar), and fludarabine (Fludara), alone or in various combinations\nMonoclonal antibodies, including Rituxan\u00ae (rituximab), which attaches to proteins on the surface of lymphoma cells and causes the cells to die\nBiological therapies designed to develop antibodies that destroy tumor cells\nProteasome inhibitors, such as Velcade\u00ae (bortezomib) or Kyprolis\u00ae(carfilzomib)\nImmunomodulating drugs (IMiDs), such as Thalomid\u00ae (thalidomide), Revlimid\u00ae (lenalidomide), and Pomalyst\u00ae (pomalidomide) that alter the environment of the tumor cells, prompting them to die\nTargeted therapies that use small molecules to block pathways that enable cells to survive and multiply\nPlasmapheresis (plasma exchange) to lower blood viscosity caused by high levels of IgM\nHigh-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation\nRadiation therapy to shrink enlarged spleen or lymph nodes if they are causing problems\n\nMost patients can be treated on an outpatient basis. Physical examinations, routine blood chemistry evaluations and tests for serum paraprotein level, serum viscosity and coagulation are performed periodically to monitor for disease progression and to aid in treatment decisions.\nIt is important for patients and doctors to discuss all possible treatment options and related side effects in order to make the best decision that suits each individual\u2019s needs. No single treatment works for all patients. If the first drug or set of drugs does not work effectively, other drugs can be tried.\nPrognosis\nDuration of survival for Waldenstrom\u2019s patients has increased over the years, with reported median survival of up to 20+ years. Survival rates are based on reported outcomes of large numbers of people, but they cannot be used alone to predict the likely outcome for any particular person, since each person\u2019s cancer responds differently to treatment. It is important that patients speak with their doctors about their specific situations.\nFuture\nIn recent years, much progress has been made with the development of new drugs that work effectively. Ongoing scientific research is bringing about advanced, targeted treatment options and improved outcomes.", "providers": [{"name": "Carolina Schinke, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12155/Schinke_Carolina-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/carolina-d-schinke/"}, {"name": "Sharmilan Thanendrarajan, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12242/Thanendrarajan_Sharmilan-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/sharmilan-thanendrarajan/"}, {"name": "Frits van Rhee, M.D., Ph.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/11206/van-Rhee_Frits-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/frits-van-rhee/"}, {"name": "Maurizio Zangari, M.D.", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/fly-images/12152/Zangari_Maurizio-253x337-cc.jpg", "specialty": "Hematologist Oncologist", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/provider/maurizio-zangari/"}], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": [{"name": "Myeloma Center", "picture": "https://uamshealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cancer-institute-512x288.jpg", "link": "https://uamshealth.com/location/myeloma-center/"}]}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/warts/": {"name": "Condition: Warts", "description": "", "providers": [], "areas_of_expertise": [], "locations": []}, "https://uamshealth.com/condition/williams-syndrome/": {"name": "Condition: Williams Syndrome (WS)", "description": "", "providers": [{"name": "Michael J.
