    "appointment_info": "Appointments with the Diabetes (Endocrine) Clinic are by referral only. Please contact your primary care doctor or visit one of our doctors in the Center for Primary Care to obtain a referral.\nWe know that many patients take time out of work or time away from family and drive long distances to come to our clinic. Our goal is to respect your time and give you the most valuable clinic experience possible. This starts with minimizing your wait time and maximizing face-to-face time with our providers. You can help by arriving and checking in 15 minutes before your scheduled visit time.   \n\nWhat to Bring to Your Appointment\n\nFor your first appointment, please bring a photo ID and your insurance card along with a list of any medications you’re taking, including over-the-counter medications. You should also bring any medical records you can provide, including slides or test results from other clinics.\nFor future appointments, please provide updated medical and insurance information.\nPlease think in advance of 1-2 top concerns that you have and bring them up right away so that the staff and physicians are aware of your priorities for the visit.  We may not get to everything if you have a very long list, but we want to be sure to take care of the top concerns and handle the others at the next visit or between visits via MyChart.\nImportant note: You should bring your blood glucose logbook, blood glucose meter, continuous glucose monitor and/or insulin pump to every visit so that this information can be discussed and reviewed to help make the best changes.  We have a saying, “Not bringing your glucose data to the endocrinologist is like seeing a pediatrician and forgetting to bring your child.”",

    "appointment_info": "Opioid Policy\nWe do not prescribe pain medicines to anyone on a first visit to our clinic.\nIf you feel you need a narcotic, we will provide information on our opioid treatment program. If you agree to participate, you will be asked to sign an Opioid Treatment Agreement and we will do all we can to help you. We will ask for a urine sample on your first visit and on future visits, as needed. Our staff will monitor the Arkansas Prescription Monitoring Programs (ArPAP). To be accepted and remain in the Opioid Treatment Program, your doctor will review your past medical records, the ArPMP report, and results of your urine drug screens. You will be required to attend routine office visits and participate in the treatment plan in order to continue in the program.\nWe do not prescribe high-risk medicines, such as Benzodiazepines, muscle relaxers or hypnotics when we prescribe opioids.\nIf you have any questions, please call our clinic at 870-572-6507. We look forward to taking care of you, your family, and all your healthcare needs.\nWhat to Bring to Your Appointment\nPlease fill out and bring all new patient forms with you to the clinic for your first visit. We will also need a copy of your driver’s license (or another photo ID) and a copy of your insurance cards.\nFor your first appointment, please check in 15 minutes before your appointment time. We will need to make sure we have your correct contact information, date of birth, address, a working phone number, and email, if you have one. We will need to verify your insurance. All co-payments and deductibles are due when you check in for your appointment.\nYour first visit will be your longest visit, as we will need to enter your information into our Electronic Medical Record. This visit will include a physical exam and we will go over your medical history. Please bring with you all medicines that you take (in their original bottles), including prescriptions, over the counter, vitamins, and herbal supplements.",
